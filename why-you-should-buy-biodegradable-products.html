                <br />The Dangers of Using Non-Biodegradable Disposable Items
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Items made from Styrofoam and plastic wind up in landfills by
                the ton every year. These products take centuries to degrade and
                when they do, they can leave toxic residue behind. Food service
                enterprises were once notorious for producing much of that
                non-biodegradable waste. In recent years, many in the food
                service industry have switched to biodegradable products made
                from vegetable matter like corn and sugar cane. Since they are
                made with naturally-occurring materials, these products break
                down easily in the soil.

              <p class="bold"><br />Biodegradable Products and Landfills</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The cost of landfills is high. In addition to paying for the
                land itself, the expense of preparing the land is also factored
                into the overall cost of opening a new landfill. That cost
                eventually gets passed on to municipal budgets and to you, the
                taxpayer. Waste products that are not biodegradable simply sit
                in landfills and take up space, essentially wasting your money.
                To make matter worse, most landfills do not provide the ideal
                environment for biodegradation. Biodegradable products may not
                be able to break down if there is not enough moisture and air.
                As a result, some landfills are being injected with water and
                microbes to enhance biodegradation. Diverting biodegradable
                waste from landfills by composting is another way to lower their
                cost and to make them more efficient. Composting provides the
                right amount of moisture and air to ensure that biodegradable
                products break down quickly.

                <br />Benefits of Using Biodegradable Instead of Petroleum-Based
                Plastics
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - The manufacture of biodegradable plastics results in far less
                environmental pollution when compared to plastics made from
                petroleum.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - When biodegradable plastics break down, they do so into
                harmless, nontoxic elements. They produce only 32 percent of the
                greenhouse gases that are emitted by petroleum-based plastics.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Biodegradable plastics require only 35 percent of the energy
                needed to make petroleum-based plastics.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - The production of petroleum-based plastics calls for 200,000
                barrels of oil to be used each day. Using plastics that are not
                petroleum based can reduce the dependence on nonrenewable
                resources.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Biodegradable plastics that are made with organic matter can
                greatly reduce the nation’s municipal waste. Instead of being
                placed in landfills, these plastics can be placed in compost
                heaps. The compost produced can be used as fertilizer.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                The use of biodegradable products is not the only solution to
                landfill problems or to the world’s environmental issues.
                However, it should be looked at as a part of the solution along
                with measures such as reducing consumption, reusing products and
                recycling.
