                Microplastics -- microscopic particles of plastic debris -- are
                of increasing concern because of their widespread presence in
                the oceans and the potential physical and toxicological risks
                they pose to organisms.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an article published today in the journal Science, the two
                scientists have called for urgent action to "turn off the tap"
                and divert plastic waste away from the marine environment.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <br />
              <p>
                Microplastics have now been documented in all five of the
                ocean's subtropical gyres -- and have even been detected in
                Arctic sea ice -- with some of the highest accumulations
                occurring thousands of miles from land. These plastic bits have
                been found in organisms ranging in size from small invertebrates
                to large mammals, and are known to concentrate toxic chemicals
                already present in seawater. This raises concern about the
                potential consequences to marine organisms.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Our scientific understanding of this environmental problem is
                accelerating rapidly, with many new research efforts that go
                well beyond simply documenting the presence of plastic in the
                ocean," said Professor Law, who led a 2008 paper in Science
                describing widespread plastic contamination in the North
                Atlantic Ocean from more than 25 years of data collected by Sea
                Education Association faculty and undergraduate students during
                SEA Semester study abroad voyages.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <br />
              <p>
                Most studies of ocean microplastic focus on the debris that
                floats at the sea surface, but this leaves other potential
                collections of plastic unaccounted for.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Major unanswered questions remain about the amounts of
                microplastic debris that might be accumulating on the seafloor,"
                said Professor Thompson, whose 2004 paper in Science first
                coined the term 'microplastics'. "We also know very little about
                where, geographically, are the largest inputs of plastic to the
                marine environment."
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite open questions such as these, the authors say that
                microplastics are already something to worry about, and that
                efforts are needed to divert the source of this debris away from
                the ocean, or to "turn off the tap." This was the message that
                Professor Thompson delivered to Senator John Kerry last month at
                the US State Department's Our Oceans Conference: Marine
                Pollution. Both say that plastic waste should be viewed as a
                valuable resource to be captured and re-used, which would
                simultaneously reduce the amount entering the environment.

                Policy initiatives have been gaining momentum at municipal,
                state, and national levels in the U.S. In June this year
                Illinois passed legislation banning microbeads (microplastics
                used in cosmetic products that enter the environment through
                wastewater), with similar legislation pending in New York and
                California, and recently introduced in the U.S. House of
                Representatives. In April this year the European Parliament
                voted to reduce the consumption of single use plastic carrier
                bags and phase out bags that fragment rather than degrade.
              </p>

                "We have been conducting an unintended experiment with the
                addition of large amounts of this human-made material into the
                environment," said Law. "But this is a solvable problem. By each
                of us making small changes in our daily habits -- by carrying
                reusable water bottles and coffee mugs, for example -- we can
                collectively reduce our dependence on 'disposable' items that
                might ultimately be lost to the environment."
