            Recycling is not about rubbish: it’s valuable commodities you’re chucking in your wheelie bin, according to
            sustainability expert Marcus Gover, not rubbish. </p>
          <p>“It feels like you are disposing of things, but really the things we’re putting out in the bin are raw
            materials and commodities: they’re plastic and paper, steel and aluminium, and they’re all quite valuable,”
            says Gover, a director at the British waste agency Wrap. “Aluminium is worth somewhere between £800 to
            £1,000 a tonne. Old Guardians [Newspapers] are worth about £80 a tonne. It’s not rubbish in any way.”</p>

            Recycling advocates </p> <br />
          <p>
            Recycling advocates – which should surely be all of us – are increasingly likely to talk up the economic
            importance of recycling. EU commissioners have even warned that Europe faces another recession if we don’t
            get better at reusing and recycling our resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Recycling has huge job creation potential, creating 10 to 200 times the jobs created by burying and burning
            all that stuff,” says Leonard. Gover argues that recycling more in the UK – recycling has flatlined in
            England in recent years – is vital to the country’s economic growth. “We talk about the UK getting its
            economic growth back, and resources are the fuel for the engine of recovery,” he says.

            Recycling also keeps stuff out of landfill,</p> <br />
          <p>
            Recycling also keeps stuff out of landfill, where it can have further environmental impacts. As well as
            causing local contamination – researchers have found abandoned UK landfills leaching ammonium into rivers –
            putting rubbish in landfill can exacerbate climate change too. Anything biodegradable that breaks down in a
            landfill, such as Newspapers and food waste, generates methane, a greenhouse gas that is much more powerful
            than CO2.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are running out of landfill, too, with just 484,370 cubic meters left in England at the end of 2014, down
            from 715,000 at the turn of the millennium. </p>
          <p>So it’s important for the economy, for our remaining wildernesses that are yet to be mined and logged, and
            for the planet’s atmosphere and climate. But is it important to you as an individual? Well, if you’d prefer
            your council tax to be spent on local libraries rather than ever-rising landfill taxes, it’s worth caring
            about. Gover says that some of its most successful promotional materials communicate to people that
            recycling more reduces costs for their local authorities.</p>
          <p>Recycling is also one of the few tangible and immediate things that anyone can do to minimise their
            environmental impact. “Recycling has a personal benefit; it gives us a chance to align our values and our
            actions, which feels good, and inspires us to do more,” says Leonard.</p>
          <p>Of course, any schoolchild will tell you that while recycling is important, it’s not as important as two
            other “Rs” – reducing and reusing. As Leonard puts it: “We shouldn’t start with recycling, but only do it
            after we have exhausted the environmentally preferable options of reducing and reusing stuff. Being able to
            recycle something is not a licence to carelessly consume, but is a last resort if we honestly cannot have
            avoided, reused, repaired or shared the stuff.”</p>
