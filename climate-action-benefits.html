            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Weather and climate play a significant role in our health and well-being. As a society, we have structured
              our day-to-day behaviors and activities around historical and current climate conditions. Increasing GHGs
              in the atmosphere are changing the climate faster than any time in recent history.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, the conditions we are accustomed to and the environment in which we live will change in ways
              that affect human health. In addition to creating new problems, changes in the climate can exacerbate
              existing human health stressors, such as air pollution and disease. Many of the adverse effects brought on
              by climate change may be compounded by how our society is changing, including population growth, an aging
              population, and migration patterns that are concentrating development in urban and coastal areas.
            </p>

              <br />How are people vulnerable to climate change?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Climate change is projected to harm human health in a variety of ways through increases in extreme
              temperature, increases in extreme weather events, decreases in air quality, and other factors.2 Extreme
              heat events can cause illnesses and death due to heat stroke, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,
              and other conditions. Increased ground-level ozone is associated with a variety of health problems,
              including reduced lung function, increased frequency of asthma attacks, and even premature mortality.</p>
            <p>Higher temperatures and changes in the timing, intensity, and duration of precipitation affect water
              quality, with impacts on the surface water we use. There are a variety of other impacts driven by climate
              change that are expected to pose significant health hazards, including increases in wildfire activity.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Air Quality
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Changes in climate are projected to affect air quality across the U.S. In already polluted areas, warmer
              temperatures are anticipated to increase ground-level ozone (O3), a component of smog, and increase the
              number of days with poor air quality.</p>
            <p>Changes in weather patterns may also affect concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a mixture
              of particles smaller than 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter
              (μg m-3), emitted from power plants, vehicles, and wildfires. Inhaling ozone and fine particulate matter
              can lead to a broad range of adverse health effects, including premature mortality and aggravation of
              cardiovascular and respiratory disease.</p>
            <p class="sub">Key Findings</p>
            <p>- Unmitigated climate change is projected to worsen air quality across large regions of the U.S.,
              especially in eastern, mid­western, and southern states. Impacts on ozone and fine particulate matter
              pollution are projected to be especially significant for densely-populated areas. The analysis holds
              emis­sions of traditional air pollutants constant at current levels to isolate the climate change related
              impact on air quality.</p>
            <p>- Global GHG mitigation is projected to reduce the impact of climate change on air quality and the
              corresponding adverse health effects related to air pollution. Mitigation is estimated to result in
              significant public health benefits in the U.S., such as avoiding 13,000 premature deaths in 2050 and
              57,000 premature deaths in 2100. Economic benefits to the U.S. of avoided premature deaths are estimated
              at $160 billion in 2050, and $930 billion in 2100.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              <br />Risks of Inaction
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Without global GHG mitigation, climate change is projected to have a substantial effect on air quality
              across the contiguous U.S., with important regional differences (Figure 1). Ozone concentrations are
              projected to increase in the Reference scenario in more densely-populated regions, such as the East,
              Midwest, and South, while some less densely-populated areas experience decreases in ozone concentrations.
            </p>
            <p>Although the national annual average ozone concentration is projected to decrease slightly (1.3 ppb +/-
              0.2) by 2100, human exposure to ozone is projected to increase, driven by increasing concentrations in
              densely-populated areas. Climate-driven ozone increases are especially substantial during summer months.
              By 2100, the U.S.-average 8-hour-maximum ozone concentration in June-August is projected to increase 4.7
              ppb (95% confidence interval ± 0.5).</p>
            <p>Unmitigated climate change is projected to exacerbate fine particulate matter pollution, especially in
              the Midwest and East. The annual U.S.-average PM2.5 concentrations are projected to increase by 0.3 μg m-3
              (± 0.1) in 2050 and 0.7 μg m-3 (± 0.1) in 2100 in the Reference scenario.</p>
            <p>Projections that climate change will lead to increased ozone in polluted regions are consistent with the
              assessment literature. There is less agreement regarding the magnitude of climate change effects on
              particulate matter, with the exception of increasing wildfire activity on particulates.11 The results
              presented in this report add to this emerging area of research.</p>

              <br />Reducing Impacts through GHG Mitigation
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Global GHG mitigation is projected to avoid significant adverse impacts to air quality that would occur
              under the Reference scenario in densely-populated areas. Figure 2 shows air quality changes in the
              Mitigation scenario, which are much smaller than those under the Reference (Figure 1). Despite smaller
              reductions in ozone in some less densely-populated areas, global GHG mitigation is projected to reduce the
              increase in the annual-average, 8-hour-maximum, population-weighted ozone concentration by approximately
              2.6 ppb (95% confidence interval ± 0.3) that would occur in the Reference in the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>Global GHG mitigation is also projected to lessen the adverse effects of climate change on fine
              particulate matter pollution in the U.S. In 2100, the increase in the annual-average population-weighted
              PM2.5 concentration under the Reference is reduced by approximately 1.2 μg m-3 (± 0.1) under the
              Mitigation scenario.</p>
            <p>Reducing the impacts of climate change on air quality through global GHG mitigation is projected to
              result in significant health benefits across the U.S. For example, the Mitigation scenario is estimated to
              prevent an estimated 13,000 premature deaths in 2050 (95% confidence interval of 4,800-22,000) and 57,000
              premature deaths in 2100 (95% confidence interval of 21,000-95,000) compared to the Reference.12 Economic
              benefits to the U.S. of these avoided deaths are estimated at $160 billion and $930 billion in 2050 and
              2100, respectively. In addition to reducing premature mortality, global GHG mitigation would result in
              other health benefits not presented here, including reduced respiratory- and cardiovascular-related
              hospital admissions.
            </p>

              <br />Treatment of Co-Benefits
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>This analysis does not quantify the additional benefits to air quality and health that would stem from
              simultaneous reductions in traditional air pollutants along with GHG emissions (both are emitted from many
              of the same sources). Incorporating these “co-benefits,” which recent analyses15 and assessments16
              indicate could provide large, near-term benefits to human health, would result in a more comprehensive
              understanding of air quality and climate interactions.
