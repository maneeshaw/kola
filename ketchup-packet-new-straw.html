              <p>
                It doesn't seem that long ago when Heinz was redesigning ketchup
                packets to make them easier to use in a minivan, but that was
                seven years ago. Heinz recently announced another redesign to
                the ubiquitous packets of ketchup, this time one that's more
                sustainable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company recently announced that it aims to make all of its
                packaging "globally recyclable, reusable or compostable by
                2025," according to Bloomberg. That means difficult-to-recycle
                packaging for products like ketchup packets, Capri Sun juice
                pouches, and the individual wrappings for Kraft Singles (Heinz
                and Kraft merged in 2015) will go through major overhauls
                because they use foil and plastic that are fused together. The
                materials aren't easily separated and therefore difficult to
                recycle, particularly in municipal recycling programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just how much of a difference can transforming
                difficult-to-recycle ketchup packets into easy-to-recycle
                packages make? Can it put dent in the enormity of the problems
                we're facing because of climate change?
              </p>
              <p>
                The change may seem small, but as of 2010, Heinz was making over
                11 billion ketchup packets a year, according to NBC News. Given
                how difficult they are to recycle, it's not unreasonable to
                believe that few, if any of them, ever are recycled. So a switch
                to recyclable materials, or better yet, reusable or compostable
                materials, will keep a good percentage of those packets out of
                the landfill. Of course, Heinz isn't the only maker of ketchup
                packets. If the companyt can create a more sustainable packet
                and share their design with other food manufacturers, that good
                deed will go even further. The design for the ketchup packets
                are also used for foods like mustard, mayo and dipping sauces.
              </p>
              <p>
                But I think there's another benefit to these small changes
                beyond the small dent they'll put in the enormity of our climate
                change problems: They keep the conversation going.
              </p>

              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p class="bold">
                <br />Small steps get you going in the right direction
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Earlier this summer the conversation was all about plastic
                straws. Everyone from McDonald's to Starbucks to the city of
                Seattle began to ban one-time-use, non-recyclable plastic
                straws. With each announcement, the environmental impact of
                plastic straws was discussed. Not only are the straws made from
                non-renewable sources and live virtually forever in a landfill,
                they are a considerable detriment to marine wildlife. They're
                hazardous to fish, turtles, birds and other wildlife, frequently
                poisoning or physically injuring them.
              </p>
              <p>
                When these conversations happen over and over, they keep the
                environment, it's problems, and the need for solutions on
                people's minds. In turn, people contact the companies they
                frequently do business with and ask them to do better with the
                sustainability of their products. Bloomberg reports that both
                consumers and investors pressed Heinz to become more sustainable
                with its packaging over the past few years. About 13 percent of
                shareholders asked for a report on the recyclability of the
                company's packaging at last April's annual meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have seen over the past several years how consumer pressure
                can influence companies to make changes for the better. General
                Mills took GMO ingredients out of original Cheerios. After an
                online petition, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese ditched artificial
                dyes. Panera eliminated 150 ingredients in its food offerings,
                including artificial preservatives, sweeteners, flavors and
                colors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every time a change makes headlines — whether it's a ban on
                plastic bag or straws, Heinz committing to more sustainable
                packaging, or even food fights over whether more sustainable
                alternatives to milk or beef can be called dairy or meat — two
                good things are happening. Positive, small sustainable changes
                are taking place, and people are paying attention, speaking up
                and demanding the next change to happen ... and the next and the
                next.
              </p>

              <p class="sub">
                Will changing the design of ketchup packets save the world from
                climate change's dangers? No, not all by itself. But in the
                absence of one big change, small changes are what we have, and
                they keep us demanding more changes — some of them small and
                some of them big.
