            Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse
            gases. This section provides information on emissions and
            removals of the main greenhouse gases to and from the
            atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>The primary greenhouse gases in the United States are:</p>

          <p class="sub"><br />Carbon dioxide (CO2)</p>
          <p>
            Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil
            fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees and wood
            products, and also as a result of certain chemical reactions
            (e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is removed from
            the atmosphere (or "sequestered") when it is absorbed by plants
            as part of the biological carbon cycle.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="sub">
            Methane (CH4)
          </p>
          <p>
            Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal,
            natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from
            livestock and other agricultural practices and by the decay of
            organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p class="sub">
            Nitrous oxide (N2O)
          </p>
          <p>
            Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial
            activities, as well as during combustion of fossil fuels and
            solid waste.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="sub">Fluorinated gases</p>
          <p>
            Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and
            nitrogen trifluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases
            that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes.
            Fluorinated gases are sometimes used as substitutes for
            stratospheric ozone-depleting substances (e.g.,
            chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and halons).
            These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but
            because they are potent greenhouse gases, they are sometimes
            referred to as High Global Warming Potential gases ("High GWP
            gases").

          <p class="bold"> <br />
            Each gas's effect on climate change depends on three main
            factors:</p>

          <p class="sub"> <br />
            1. How much of these gases are in the atmosphere?
          </p>
          <p>
            Concentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas
            in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher
            concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations
            are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even
            parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one
            drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly
            the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the
            increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
            visit the Causes of Climate Change and the Climate Change
            Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases
            pages.
          </p>
          <p class="sub"> <br />2. How long do they stay in the atmosphere?</p>
          <p>
            Each of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different
            amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years.
            All of these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to
            become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in
            the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world,
            regardless of the source of the emissions.
          </p>
          <p class="sub"> <br />
            3. How strongly do they impact global temperatures?
          </p>
          <p>
            Some gases are more effective than others at making the planet
            warmer and "thickening the Earth's blanket."
          </p>
          <p>
            For each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) has
            been calculated to reflect how long it remains in the
            atmosphere, on average, and how strongly it absorbs energy.
            Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per pound, than
            gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming
            Earth.
          </p>

            Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human
            activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in
            greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1 The
            largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities
            in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for
            electricity, heat, and transportation.
          </p>

          <p class="bold"> <br />The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="sub">Electricity production </p>
          <p>(30 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Electricity production generates the largest share of
            greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 67 percent of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels,
            mostly coal and natural gas.</p>
          <p class="sub">Transportation </p>
          <p>(26 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation primarily
            come from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes. Over 90 percent of the fuel
            used for transportation is petroleum based, which includes gasoline and diesel.</p>
          <p class="sub">Industry</p>
          <p>(21 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come
            from burning fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions
            necessary to produce goods from raw materials.</p>
          <p class="sub">Commercial and Residential </p>
          <p> (12 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and Newss arise
            primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of certain products that contain greenhouse gases,
            and the handling of waste.</p>
          <p class="sub">Agriculture </p>
          <p> (9 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from
            livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.</p>
          <p class="sub">Land Use and Forestry </p>
          <p>(offset of 11 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO2
            from the atmosphere) or a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, since 1990, managed
            forests and other lands have absorbed more CO2 from the atmosphere than they emit.</p>
          <br />

          <div class="HorLine5"></div>
          <p class="bold"> <br />
            Emissions and Trends
          </p>
          <p>Since 1990, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by about 7 percent. From year to year, emissions
            can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2014, U.S.
            greenhouse gas emissions increased compared to 2013 levels. This increase was due to a number of factors,
            including: cold winter conditions resulting in an increase in fuel demand, especially in residential and
            commercial sectors; an increase in transportation emissions resulting from an increase in vehicle miles
            traveled; and an increase in industrial production across multiple sectors that also resulted in increases
            in industrial sector emissions.</p>
