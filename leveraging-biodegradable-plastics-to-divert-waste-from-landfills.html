                Plastic is ubiquitous. It’s used in everything from your shampoo
                bottle to your golf shirt. Unfortunately, traditional
                petroleum-based plastics are notorious contributors to landfill
                waste. According to a 2017 study in Science Advances, of the 8.3
                billion metric tons of virgin plastics produced since the 1950s,
                about 6.3 billion metric tons have been disposed of in landfills
                or the natural environment. If this trend continues, that number
                could increase to 12 billion metric tons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Municipal solid waste landfills (i.e., landfills) are assigned
                areas of land or excavation that receive household waste. They
                can only be built in “suitable geological areas away from
                faults, wetlands, floodplains or other restricted areas.” In
                addition, they need a composite liner (i.e., a geo-membrane) two
                feet above its compacted clay soil lining to protect groundwater
                and the underlying soil from leachate releases. Despite the
                standards in place, disposed products degrade and produce
                landfill gas composed of methane and carbon dioxide; both gases
                are highly effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere,
                especially methane.
              </p>
              <p>
                Landfills are only designed to store waste, not break them down.
                Unfortunately, the rate at which we are producing waste outpaces
                the rate of natural biodegradation. Consequently, landfills are
                quickly filling up, which increases air, water and soil
                pollution. In 2014 alone, 136 million tons of municipal solid
                waste were landfilled, 18% of which were plastic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disposal of non-biodegradable plastics is unsustainable
                because they often follow a linear economic model where virgin
                products are manufactured, used once and disposed of,
                accumulating in landfills or the natural environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                While recycling is one solution to divert waste from landfills
                and reduce the production of virgin materials, only 9% of
                plastics made since 1950 have been recycled. Recycling simply
                delays disposal, which is why biodegradation and composting
                should also be considered as solutions. Biodegradable plastic
                aids in directing waste away from landfills and to composting
                facilities. This not only decreases the burden placed on
                landfills but also lowers methane emissions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at alternative solutions to recycling will become more
                important in light of recent global events. For decades, the
                United States has relied on China to recycle its plastic waste.
                As of January 2018, China is no longer accepting plastic in an
                effort to protect their citizens’ health. This puts more
                pressure on domestic recycling infrastructure, forcing the U.S.
                to further explore alternate waste solutions such as industrial
                composting.

                <br />Certifying plastic products for industrial composting
              </p>
              <p>
                While there are a variety of plastics on the market that claim
                to be biodegradable, industrial composting facilities only
                accept certified compostable plastics, which is why
                understanding the various certifications is critical before
                beginning manufacturing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Products and packaging that are certified compostable won’t
                impede commercial composting operations or contaminate the
                compost. Common certifications include ASTM, BPI and CMA.

              <p class="bold"><br />ASTM D6400</p>
              <p>
                ASTM D6400 certifies that plastics and products have been
                developed to compost in municipal and industrial aerobic
                composting facilities. The certification ensures that products
                will biodegrade at a proper rate in a facility.

              <p class="bold"><br />Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI)</p>
              <p>
                For a product to be certified by BPI, it must first be certified
                ASTM D6400-12. BPI testing is conducted by independent labs that
                will ensure products can biodegrade at a comparable rate to
                other compostable materials so that large plastic fragments
                don’t need to be screened out.

              <p class="bold"><br />Composting manufacturing alliance (CMA)</p>
              <p>
                The CMA field testing program specifically certifies that food
                service ware (e.g., bags, utensils, plates and wraps) is
                compostable in facilities. CMA will provide insights on how well
                these products will break down in a composting facility.
                Ultimately, the program strives to divert food waste from
                landfills and “minimize contamination in urban feedstocks.”

              <p>
                Ken Powell, the Public Service Executive at the Kansas Bureau of
                Waste Management said the key driver for bringing composting
                facilities to a city is policy and access but cautions that
                “cost, education and infrastructure are needed to get people
                composting.” More specifically, Sarah Ryan, the Marketing
                Coordinator at St. Louis Composting, notes that some challenges
                include educating consumers and companies about the differences
                between bio-based, biodegradable, recyclable and compostable
                plastics as well as implementing a universal labeling system to
                prevent contaminants from entering composting facilities.

              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p class="bold"><br />Addressing contamination challenges</p>
              <p>
                Contamination is a key challenge for composting facilities.
                Improperly sorted plastics can contaminate recycling streams or
                feedstock and get buried landfills. Most contamination results
                from petroleum-based plastics entering facilities due to:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>- Inaccurate labeling.</p>
              <br />
              <p>- Confusion on disposal instructions.</p>
              <br />
              <p>- Ignorance of best waste management practices.</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Not all bioplastics are compostable, which is why
                inconsistencies in labeling and definitions puzzle customers.
                Although contamination is avoidable, a systematic solution will
                be needed to eliminate the issue entirely, which could include:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>- Educating customers.</p>
              <br />
              <p>- Implementing fines for improper disposal.</p>
              <br />
              <p>- Rejecting contaminated loads.</p>
              <br />
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p class="bold"><br />Processing biodegradable plastics</p>
              <p>
                To leverage the benefits of biodegradable plastics, more
                products will need to be produced with these materials. A study
                by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Germany
                examined the manufacturability of biodegradable plastics as
                compared to conventional plastics based on processing parameters
                such as shrinkage behavior, plasticizing capacity and processing
                temperature for injection molding. The study found that,
                overall, the processing of biodegradable plastics is similar to
                that of conventional plastics and reasonable cycle times can be
                achieved.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with switching from one conventional plastic to another,
                though, switching to bioplastics requires the injection molder
                to make material-specific modifications to their processing
                parameters. For example, an injection molder might need to dry
                the plastic prior to processing, lower processing temperatures
                or adjust the cavity parameters to account for different
                shrinkage behaviors between the two materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                While pre-drying is a key processing consideration for all
                bioplastics, it is critical for biodegradable plastics. Excess
                moisture present in biodegradable plastics will not only cause
                processing problems (i.e., decreased mechanical performance and
                increased melt index), but the moisture may cause hydrolysis in
                the material resulting in a loss of molecular weight while the
                product is in use. To prevent such issues, the processing
                recommendations set forth by the biodegradable plastic
                manufacturer should always be followed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common misconception is that biodegradable plastics, as a
                category, exhibit a narrow range of physical properties. In
                reality, material manufacturers are now capable of alloying and
                blending biodegradable polymers (e.g., PLA, PBS, PBAT, etc.) to
                meet specific performance parameters without sacrificing
                compostability. The percent elongation of PLA, a generally rigid
                polymer, can be increased as much as 18.7% when compounded with
                a compostable elastomeric bioplastic. Using the same impact
                modifier, the impact strength of PLA can be increased more than
                400%.

              <p>
                Governmental incentives and consumer expectations need to first
                shift towards composting and biodegradation. Doing so will
                influence the plastic industry to value biodegradable and
                compostable plastics over petroleum-based plastics. The current
                waste management system affords consumers and companies with
                convenience. However, it took decades for it to come to
                fruition. As such, implementing a circular economy, where
                plastic is biodegraded, recycled or composted, and systemizing
                it to become convenient like the current system, will take time.
