                The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the
                last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial
                advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age
                about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern
                climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate
                changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit
                that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have
                enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many
                different types of information about our planet and its climate
                on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years,
                reveals the signals of a changing climate.

                  contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements,

                The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was
                demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect
                the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the
                scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no
                question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause
                the Earth to warm in response.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical
                mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to
                changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be
                found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of
                sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence
                reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times
                faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.

              <br />
              <p class="sub">Global Temperature Rise</p>
              <p>
                The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62
                degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th
                century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and
                other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.4 Most of the
                warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest
                years on record taking place since 2010. Not only was 2016 the
                warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up
                the year — from January through September, with the exception of
                June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Warming Oceans</p>
              <p>
                The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the
                top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of
                more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Shrinking Ice Sheets</p>
              <p>
                The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass.
                Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show
                Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year
                between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion
                tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of
                Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Glacial Retreat</p>
              <p>
                Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world —
                including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and
                Africa.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Decreased Snow Cover</p>
              <p>
                Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow
                cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past
                five decades and that the snow is melting earlier.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Sea Level Rise</p>
              <p>
                Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The
                rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of
                the last century and is accelerating slightly every year.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Declining Arctic Sea Ice</p>
              <p>
                Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined
                rapidly over the last several decades.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Extreme Events</p>
              <p>
                The number of record high temperature events in the United
                States has been increasing, while the number of record low
                temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has
                also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="sub">Ocean Acidification</p>
              <p>
                Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of
                surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.13,14
                This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon
                dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into
                the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper
                layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per
                year.
