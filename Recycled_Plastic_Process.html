                The recycled plastic process recovers scrap or discarded plastic
                and reclaims it into something new and useful. Most plastics are
                recyclable, but first they have to be separated into their
                polymer types. Plastics are separated according to their resin
                identification code, which were developed by the Society of the
                Plastics Industry in 1988. Manufacturers can voluntarily mark
                their products with the identification code. This makes it
                easier for consumers to recycle. Some municipalities require
                that households sort their plastics by code before leaving them
                out for curbside recycling.

              <p class="bold"><br />Types of Plastics</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 1 is PET and PETE or polyethylene. Common applications of
                this plastic are soda and water bottles and peanut butter jars.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 2 is HDPE or high density polyethylene. Common
                applications are milk and juice jugs and plastic bags for trash
                and shopping.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 3 is PVC or polyvinylchloride. PVC piping and juice
                bottles are common applications of PVC.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 4 is LDPE or low density polyethylene. Frozen food bags,
                and ketchup and mustard bottles are often made from LDPE.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 5 is polypropylene of PP. Tupperware and disposable cups
                and plates are often made using polypropylene.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 6 is PS or polystyrene. Common applications for PS are
                egg cartons and packing peanuts.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Type 7 refers to all other types of plastic.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The most commonly recycled plastics are type 1, 2 and 6. These
                plastics are downcycled into other plastic items. Type 1
                plastics are often turned into non-food containers. Type 2
                plastics are used to make plastic lumber. Type 6 can be turned
                into trays, pens and insulation. Related Articles

                <br />Challenges in the Recycled Plastic Process
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The reason plastics must be separated by identification code is
                that plastics have a high molecular weight. In fact they are
                more difficult to recycle than glass and metal. Heat alone is
                not enough to dissolve plastic. The recycling process is easier
                when different types of plastic are not mixed together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another challenge in the recycled plastic process is the large
                amount of dyes, filler and other additives used in the plastic
                manufacturing process. Fillers are used make plastics pliable
                but they are very difficult to remove during recycling.
                Additives are used less frequently in plastic bags, which is why
                these items are recycled at higher rates.
              </p>

              <p class="bold"><br />Recycling Plastics</p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Despite the challenges, more and more plastic is being recycled
                every year. The amount of plastics that are recycled has
                increased every year since 1990. More than 1,800 U.S. businesses
                reclaim post-consumer plastics according to the American
                Plastics Council. Still, the United States only recycled about
                five percent of the plastics produced domestically. Will
                changing the design of ketchup packets save the world from
                climate change's dangers? No, not all by itself. But in the
                absence of one big change, small changes are what we have, and
                they keep us demanding more changes â€” some of them small and
                some of them big.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plastics are collected from curbside recycling bins and drop-off
                locations. From there, they go to a material recovery facility,
                where they are sorted and sent to a reclamation facility. At the
                reclamation facility, the plastic is inspected and washed. Next
                it is chopped into small flakes. The flakes are placed in a
                flotation tank and then dried in a tumbler. The dried flakes are
                placed in an extruder where they are melted. These extruders are
                expensive to operate. The melted plastic is sifted through a
                screen to remove any contaminants and then it is formed into
                strands. Finally, the strands are chopped into pellets and sold
                to manufacturers to make new products.
              </p>
              <p>
                As new technologies are developed, the cost of the recycling
                plastic process will decrease and hopefully the amount of
                plastic recycled will increase. At the same time, consumers are
                becoming more aware of the impact of waste on the planet and
                they are working to reduce the use of plastic bottles and bags.
