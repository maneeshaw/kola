                The properties that make plastic popular, like its light weight,
                water impermeability and long life are the same things that make
                disposing of it very difficult. Recycling plastic is a more
                realistic approach than tossing it in a landfill.

              <br />
              <p>
                There are several ways you can dispose of plastic. The most
                obvious is to recycle. However, the majority of plastic ends up
                in landfills. Some plastics are made to be biodegradable while
                others are compostable, requiring you to take them to a
                commercial composting center.
              </p>
              <p>
                The United States Public Interest Research Group (US PRIG)
                reports that 94% of Americans are in favor of recycling and 70%
                Americans agree that recycling should be set as a priority.
                However, only 34.7% of Americans actually recycle. Wrap
                Recycling Action Program (WRAP) reports that 90% Americans have
                access to plastic bag and plastic film recycling at over 18,000
                retail and grocery location.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Worldwatch Institute found that Americans and Europeans use
                an average of 100 kilos of plastic packaging every year.
              </p>
              <p>
                SloActive reports a study in 2017, found that 67% of the plastic
                found in oceans comes from 20 top contributing rivers to are
                mostly located in Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Less than 10% of the plastic used is recycled every year in the
                U.S. The remaining 33 million tons go to waste, with 22-43%
                ending up in landfills, and the rest being incinerated or
                littered; all three impact the environment and affect human and
                wildlife health leading to enormous costs.

              <br />
              <p>
                Recycling at consumer, community and national levels is fairly
                inadequate and inefficient. There are 7 grades of plastic that
                are stamped on plastic containers and bottles for recycling
                purposes.

              <p class="sub">Recyclable Plastics</p>
              <p>
                Most plastics are recyclable. Much depends on what the plastic
                is used for and what type of material it contains.
              </p>
              <p>
                - PET (1) is mostly used for beverage and water bottles.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - HDPE (2) is used for milk jugs and various liquids, such as
                cooking oil and washing detergents.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Polyvinyl Chloride-PVC (3) is used to make cling wrap, dry
                erase boards, signs, and other items.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - LDPE (4) is used for plastic bags for bread, shopping and dry
                cleaning bags, etc.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Polypropylene-PP (5) is used for food containers, such as sour
                cream, ketchup, bottle caps, etc.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Polystyrene-PS (6) is often a foam product that's used for
                coffee cups, packaging, knifes, forks, spoons, and other items.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                - Polycarbonate and polylactide (7) used for medical devices, or
                in electrical and electronics, are seldom recycled.

              <p class="bold"><br />Number of Years To Breakdown Plastics</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In a landfill, PET can take 10 years to degrade and decompose.
                The MDPI notes that PET can take up to 50 years to fully
                degrade. This process could occur faster if plastic is exposed
                to light. The material recovery facility Mercer Group
                International notes that most plastics take 200 to 400 years for
                decomposition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other plastics and the years it takes for them to breakdown
                include: PS takes 50 years, HDPE takes 100 years, LDPE takes 500
                years, and PP takes 1000 years.

              <br />
              <p>
                The toxic chemicals in plastic interact with water and leach
                into the ground and pollute groundwater reservoirs harming
                wildlife and people. Plastic uses bisphenol A (BPA), a
                carcinogen, and more recently bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F
                (BPF) as hardening agents. Other chemicals are added as
                flame-retardants or coloring agents, all of which affect hormone
                activity. Phthalates, contained in food packaging and medical
                devices, and

              <br />
              <p>
                Incineration, another common plastic waste management method,
                can be injurious to health. The release of toxic chemicals
                listed as Persistent Organic Pollutants, or POPs, are dangerous
                when inhaled.
                <br />

              <p>
                - Materials made of plastics 2, 4, 5, and 6 burn fast with an

              <br />
              <p>
                The largest impact has been on marine ecosystems, with 10% of
                all plastic produced ending up in the oceans. Plastic is very
                'mobile' given its low density and light weight, and items from
                illegal litters, dumps, and landfills blow over to streams and
                rivers, and is carried to oceans or is washed up on beaches.

              <br />
              <p>
                80% of marine waste comes from land sources and an additional
                20% is dumped by ocean liners and platforms, and the Environment
                Protection Agency (EPA) has found that 33% to 66% of these are
                single-use plastic packaging for food and drinks, cups, utensils
                and cutlery, that could be recycled.

                HDPE, LDPE and PP items float, and gyres are formed when they
                accumulate due to currents and cyclonic action. Some gyres are
                colossal in size. The Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch is
                larger than the state of Texas. There are four large gyres in
                the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, too.

              <p>
                The other kinds of plastics are heavy and sink to ocean floors.
                Thousands of animals from small finches to great white sharks
                are killed as they get entangled in discarded fishing nets.
                Three hundred species of animals ingest plastic mistaking it for
                food; for example sea-turtles mistake bellowing plastic for
                jellyfish. Nearly 100,000 animals die every year; some starve to
                death as plastics fill their bellies and there is no place left
                for food. Others are affected by the toxic elements added to
                plastic.

              <br />
              <p>
                Plastic breaks down into micro-plastics rapidly, though it takes
                a long time to decompose completely. Because of the size, even
                small insects eat micro-plastic. Once ingested by small animals,
                plastic can find its way to people's tables by a process called
                bioaccumulation. When animals are eaten by bigger predatory fish
                and other sea-life, plastics, and the chemicals in them, get
                more concentrated as they move up the food-chain. Up to 67% of
                edible species of seafood, and 25% of catch in the US has
                plastic in them.

              <br />
              <p>
                Energy used to make base plastic from feedstock and manufacture
                different products accounts for 2.5 to 4% of U.S. energy
                consumption. If a plastic item is thrown away, it cannot be
                reused or remade into another plastic item. The base plastic in
                the item becomes a total waste. Raw materials and natural
                resources, such as water and energy, are needed to create new
                plastics. If the plastic item is recycled, the base plastic can
                be reused to create a new plastic item, frequently using fewer
                natural resources in the manufacturing process.

                Not all plastic you recycle ends up recycled. There are various
                reasons why this might happen. When it does, the plastic may end
                up in a landfill. The plastic may end up buried underneath tons
                of trash. Over time, the harmful toxic chemicals are leached
                into the ground and find their way into the groundwater and
                potentially contaminating drinking water supplies, rivers,
                streams, and eventually the ocean.

              <p class="sub"><br />Harmful to Animals</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Just as marine life consumes the plastic floating in the oceans,
                land animals scavenging in landfills ingest a certain amount of
                plastic. In addition, they often become entangled with different
                types of plastic that can lad to strangulation and injuries.

                livelihoods when tourism is affected. In California, more than
                half a billion dollars are spent annually to clean beachfronts
                for tourism. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region report losses
                of $622 million a year due to littered beaches, while fishing
                industries lose $364 million per year, and the shipping
                industries lose $279 million each year. So the total cost of
                marine pollution in this region alone is $1.265 billion per
                year.

              <br />
              <p>
                In 2019, The Guardian reported the global cost of marine plastic
                pollution is $2.5 trillion. That is a significant increase over
                the 2014 UN News estimate of a "natural capital cost" of $75
                billion due to use of plastic. 30% or more of the cost derives
                from greenhouse emissions due to petroleum extraction and energy
                use in its production. On the other hand, recycling of plastics
                has helped recover plastics worth $4 billion each year.

              <p class="bold"><br />Reduce Plastic Waste</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Decrease plastic production by increasing the amounts of plastic
                recycled. Without recycling, this "wasted" plastic cannot be
                reworked and reused. Instead, new plastic must be made,
                requiring additional natural resources. You can help to save the
                environment by keeping wasted plastics out of the landfills,
                air, and oceans as well as cut down on natural resource used to
                make new plastics.
