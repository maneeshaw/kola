                its carbon footprint,”
              </p>
              <p>
                said Captain Charles Moore, who, in 1997, discovered the Great
                Pacific Garbage Patch. Its name is misleading because the huge
                expanse of floating marine debris is actually more like a soup
                of confetti-sized plastic bits, produced by the runoff of our
                throwaway lifestyle that has made its way into our oceans.

              <br />
              <p>
                The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the most notorious stretch of
                plastic debris, is located northeast of Hawaii, about 1000 miles
                from Hawaii and California. It’s an enormous and immeasurable
                area of marine debris, trapped by one of the five major
                subtropical gyres (systems of ocean currents) that corrals and
                carries marine garbage into its vortex. 5 Gyres, an organization
                that partners with Moore’s Algalita Marine Research Foundation
                to study plastic pollution in the ocean, has sent expeditions
                across the North Pacific Gyre, the North and South Atlantic
                Gyres, and the Indian Ocean Gyre, and found plastic in every one
                of them, though concentrations vary. Some reports have estimated
                the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to be twice the size of the
                continental United States, but no one can accurately measure the
                boundaries of the trash gyres because they are vast, remote and
                always shifting with ocean conditions. In any case, plastic
                marine debris is now found on the surface of every ocean on
                Earth.

                Some plastic and marine debris comes from fishing gear, offshore
                oil and gas platforms, and ships. But 80 percent of it comes
                from the land—litter that gets stuck in storm drains and is
                washed into rivers and out to sea, the legal and illegal dumping
                of garbage and appliances, and plastic resin pellets
                inadvertently spilled and unloaded by plastic manufacturers.
                Trash Travels, Ocean Conservancy’s 2010 report, states that 60
                percent of all marine debris in 2009 consisted of “disposable”
                items, with the most common being cigarettes, plastic bags, food
                containers, bottle caps and plastic bottles. And no matter where
                the litter originates, once it reaches the ocean, it becomes a
                planetary problem as garbage travels thousands of miles carried
                by the gyres.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lightness and durability that make plastic such a useful and
                versatile material for manufacturers also make it a long-term
                problem for the environment. Trash Travels estimates that
                plastic bags can take 20 years to decompose, plastic bottles up
                to 450 years, and fishing line, 600 years; but in fact, no one
                really knows how long plastics will remain in the ocean. With
                exposure to UV rays and the ocean environment, plastic breaks
                down into smaller and smaller fragments. The majority of the
                plastic found in the ocean are tiny pieces less than 1 cm. in
                size, with the mass of 1/10 of a paper clip.

                <br />Sea Education Association’s (SEA) expedition
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The Sea Education Association’s (SEA) expedition to the western
                North Atlantic Ocean found bits of HDPE (high density
                polyethylene), LDPE (low density polyethylene), and PP
                (polypropylene) from items such as milk containers, plastic
                bags, and straws, which float on the surface because they are
                less dense than seawater. It did not find PET (polyethylene
                terephthalate), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and PS (polystyrene
                solid), which sink because they are denser than seawater.
                Algalita, which sampled down to depths of 100 hundred meters
                throughout the eastern side of the North Pacific Gyre, found
                LDPE, styrene, PP and PET.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last year, SEA released the results of its 22-year study of
                plastic pollution in the western North Atlantic and Caribbean
                Sea. The greatest amount of plastic was found in the North
                Atlantic Gyre, which contains the Sargasso Sea. The most plastic
                collected during a 30-minute tow was 1069 pieces, which, if
                scaled up, would be equal to about 580,000 pieces per square
                kilometer. The average concentration of samples would roughly
                equal 20,300 pieces per square kilometer. While discarded
                plastic in the U.S. quadrupled between 1980 and 2008, however,
                the concentration of debris in the Atlantic did not appear to
                increase. Where has it all gone? Lead scientist Kara Lavender
                Law speculated that some is being eaten by marine animals, some
                has broken down into bits too small to be captured by tow nets,
                some gets washed up onto beaches, and some is sinking to the
                ocean floor. According to Project Kaisei, a non-profit also
                studying marine debris, 70 percent of the man-made waste that
                enters the ocean sinks to the bottom. That means that the
                plastic soup is only the 30 percent of the debris that floats.
                No one knows what lies deep down because so far, there have been
                no studies of the plastic on the ocean floor.
              </p>
              <p>
                But we know the plastic debris on the surface of the ocean is
                taking its toll on marine life. Animals get strangled in fishing
                lines, nets, and plastic litter. Fish and seabirds ingest bits
                of plastic they mistake for food that can block their intestinal
                tracts and kill them, or make them feel full so that they do not
                eat real food.One of Moore’s expeditions collected hundreds of
                samples of fish, and conducted necropsies on them: over 1/3 had
                ingested polluted plastic fragments, including one 2.5 inch fish
                that had 84 pieces of plastic in its tiny gut. In 1999, Moore’s
                research in the Central Pacific found six times more plastic
                than zooplankton in the water. In 2002, off the coast of
                Southern California, he discovered the ratio of plastic to
                plankton was 2.5. Preliminary results on samples Algalita took
                in 2008 already show that there is a significant increase in the
                ratio of plastic to plankton in the water.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <br />
              <p>
                Plastic bits also create habitats for microorganisms and other
                species, allowing would-be invasive species to hitch rides to
                new areas of the ocean.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <br />
              <p>
                A recent study found that plastics take up and accumulate
                persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as carcinogenic and
                endocrine-disrupting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
                polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine
                pesticides such as DDD, a derivative of DDT. Over 50 percent of
                the plastic samples studied contained PCBs, and over 75 percent
                contained PAHs. According to Moore, plastic debris can attract
                and concentrate POPs up to a million times their levels in the
                surrounding seawater, and when consumed by marine animals, the
                POPs endanger both the creatures that ingest them and humans
                higher up on the food chain, especially infants. Moore has said,
                “No fish monger on Earth can sell you a certified organic
                wild-caught fish.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite all these environmental and potential human health
                impacts, most scientists agree that it is not feasible to clean
                up the plastic soup in our oceans. The areas are huge, and the
                debris is unevenly distributed and always shifting. A cleanup
                would entail filtering enormous amounts of water, and the
                by-catch of plankton and other marine organisms would be harmful
                to ocean ecosystems. Moreover, the fact that the trash gyres are
                in the open ocean, in international waters, makes it difficult
                to get governments to invest in research or cleanup efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Undaunted, Project Kaisei, on its two expeditions to the North
                Pacific Gyre, has been working to develop and test new methods
                for removal of some of the plastic waste. Its goal is to learn
                more about how to efficiently remove the floating plastic, and
                to use new techniques to recycle the material into fuel or other
                products. Project Kaisei plans to test new, and scaled-up catch
                methods on future expeditions, as well as passive netting and
                catch methods that require little fuel and have low impacts on
                marine life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moore and Algalita believe that the best way to deal with the
                plastic debris is to stop the waste from entering the ocean in
                the first place: to replace, reduce, reuse and recycle our
                plastics. Marcus Eriksen, one of the founders of 5 Gyres, also
                promotes beach cleanup because “What we now know is that if we
                stop adding more plastic to the ocean, in time the gyres will
                kick out the plastic pollution they currently hold. If you want
                to clean the gyre, clean your beach.” In 2010, approximately
                500,000 volunteers did just that, taking part in the 25th Annual
                International Coastal Cleanup and removing millions of pounds of
                marine debris from 6,000 sites around the world, including all
                50 U.S. states.
