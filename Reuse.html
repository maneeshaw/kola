            <p>Reuse is the action or practice of using an item, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse)
              or to fulfill a different function (creative reuse or repurposing). It should be distinguished from
              recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new
              products. Reuse &ndash; by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items &ndash; helps save time,
              money, energy and resources. In broader economic terms, it can make quality products available to people
              and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the
              economy.</p>

            <p>Historically, financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world, this
              driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the
              convenience of disposable products have made the reuse of low-value items such as packaging uneconomic in
              richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is
              gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually
              beginning to reverse the situation.</p>

            <p>One example of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of milk in glass bottles; other examples
              include the retreading of tires and the use of returnable/reusable plastic boxes, shipping containers,
              instead of single-use corrugated fiberboard boxes.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              <br />Advantages and disadvantages
            </p>
            <p class="sub">Reuse has certain potential advantages:</p>
            <p>However, the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment products remains low due to inadequate
              infrastructure, lack of repair networks and products. Local authority collection systems are better suited
              for handling waste than handling goods and preserving reuse potential. Retailer delivery staff are trained
              to handle goods carefully.</p>

            <p>So, do we need a radical rethink on how we move unwanted, still usable items to the second-hand market
              place? Is there a case for changing our approach to producer responsibility and insisting that producers
              finance collection for reuse, and additionally, drive consumer choices for reuse, repair and
              remanufacture; whilst addressing the costs of recycling and disposal?</p>

            <p>There are opportunities for producers, waste management companies and local authorities to make both
              repair and reuse habitual, whilst these require changes to householder behavior change through raising
              awareness, they also require investment in infrastructure and logistical operations. Is it time to insist
              that more products are designed to have longer lifetimes? That they can be disassembled, repaired and
              reused before being recycled?</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Business models providing opportunities
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>This would not necessarily be a poor strategy for businesses, there are business models that provide
              opportunities to retain ownership of valuable products and components through leasing, servicing, repair
              and re-sale.</p>

            <p>While it is choices made by consumers that will ultimately determine the success of such ventures, there
              is enormous potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and
              environmental benefits. The EU Circular Economy Package, the Scottish Circular Economy Strategy, and the
              national reuse target set by the Spanish Government are examples of governments recognizing that
              second-hand goods should be a good value mainstream option and are working towards making reuse easier for
              consumers.</p>

            <p>In environmental terms, reuse ought to be more common than recycling and energy recovery, with both the
              financial and environmental costs of a simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original
              manufacturing costs. If we are going to be serious about living in a Circular Economy, we need to
              recognize the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the
              use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused, and materials are recycled rather than
              landfilled.</p>

              <br />Remanufacturing
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The most involved reuse organizations are &quot;repair and overhaul&quot; industries which take valuable
              parts, such as engine blocks, office furniture, toner cartridges, single-use cameras, aircraft hulls, and
              cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) and refurbish them in a factory environment in order to meet the same/similar
              specifications as new products. Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing
              factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore;
              Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China.[citation needed] Some
              factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). When the refurbished item
              is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs or cameras resold under a new label), this
              has been found legal by most courts.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>When the item is resold under the same OEM name, it is informally considered a &quot;gray market&quot;
              item - if it is sold as used, it's legal, if it's represented as an OEM product eligible for rebates and
              warranties, it is considered &quot;counterfeit&quot; or &quot;black market&quot;.[citation needed] The
              automobile parts industry in the USA is governed by laws on the disclosure of &quot;used&quot; parts and,
              in some states, mattresses which have been used are required to be sanitized or destroyed.[8] Whether
              these laws are in place to protect consumers from black market items or to protect manufacturers
              (&quot;hindsight obsolescence&quot;), is often an area of intense debate.[citation needed] Fuji Photo Film
              Co. v. Jazz Photo Corp. is a recent example of the war between patent holders and refurbishing factories.
              To quote the 2003 District Court of New Jersey:&quot;Thus, the key issue in the dispute between Fuji and
              Jazz is whether the cameras sold by Jazz are &quot;refurbished&quot; in such a way that they can be
              considered to have been permissibly &quot;repaired&quot; or impermissibly &quot;reconstructed.&quot;</p>

              <br />Package deposit programs
            </p>
            <p>Deposit programs offer customers a financial incentive to return packaging for reuse. Although no longer
              common, international experience is showing that they can still be an effective way to encourage packaging
              reuse.[citation needed] However, financial incentive, unless great, maybe less of an incentive than
              convenience: statistics show that, on average, a milk bottle is returned 12 times, whereas a lemonade
              bottle with a 15p deposit is returned, on average, only 3 times.[</p>

            <p>Refillable bottles are used extensively in many European countries; for example in Denmark, 98% of
              bottles are refillable, and 98% of those are returned by consumers. These systems are typically supported
              by deposit laws and other regulations.</p>

            <p>Sainsbury Ltd have operated a plastic carrier bag cash refund scheme in 1991 - &ldquo;the penny back
              scheme&rdquo;.The scheme is reported to save 970 tonnes of plastic per annum. The scheme has now been
              extended to a penny back on a voucher which can be contributed to schools registered on the scheme; it
              estimates this will raise the savings in plastic to 2500 tonnes per annum.</p>

            <p>
              The 600 ml brown bottle is the &quot; standard beer reused bottle&quot; in Brazil.<br />
              In some developing nations like India and Pakistan, the cost of new bottles often forces manufacturers to
              collect and refill old glass bottles for selling cola and other drinks. India and Pakistan also have a way
              of reusing old newspapers: &quot;Kabadiwalas&quot; buy these from the readers for scrap value and reuse
              them as packaging or recycle them. Scrap intermediaries help consumer dispose of other materials including
              metals and plastics.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              <br />Closed-loop programs
            </p>
            <p>These apply primarily to items of packaging, for example, where a company is involved in the regular
              transportation of goods from a central manufacturing facility to warehouses or warehouses to retail
              outlets. In these cases, there is considerable benefit to using reusable &ldquo;transport packaging&rdquo;
              such as plastic crates or pallets.</p>

            <p>The benefits of closed-loop reuse are primarily due to low additional transport costs being involved, the
              empty lorry returning with the empty crates. There have been some recent attempts to get the public to
              join in on closed-loop reuse schemes where shoppers use reusable plastic baskets in place of carrier bags
              for transporting their goods home from the supermarket; these baskets fit on specially designed trolleys
              making shopping supposedly easier.</p>

            <p class="bold">
              <br />Refilling programs
            </p>
            <p>There have been some market-led initiatives to encourage packaging reuse by companies introducing refill
              packs of certain commodities (mainly soap powders and cleaning fluids), the contents being transferred
              before use into a reusable package kept by the customer, with the savings in packaging being passed onto
              the customer by lower shelf prices. The refill pack itself is not reused, but being a minimal package for
              carrying the product home, it requires less material than one with the durability and features (reclosable
              top, convenient shape, etc.) required for easy use of the product, while avoiding the transport cost and
              emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory.</p>
            <br />

            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Regifting
            </p>
            <p>Some items, such as clothes and children's toys, often become unwanted before they wear out due to
              changes in their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new
              owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbors, through environmental
              freecycling organizations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation
              Army, and Goodwill, which gives these items to those who could not afford them new. Other organizations
              such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's
              school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for
              example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately
              296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed
              into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members
              promise not to buy anything new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown
              away. Reuse not only reduces landfill in line with the waste minimization program but can help raise
              money for a good cause.</p>

              <p class="bold">
                <br />Repurposing
              </p>
              <p>Repurposing is to use a tool for use as another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk or garbage. A good example of this would be the Earthship style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose. Examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and/or composting bins.</p>

              <p class="bold">
                <br />Waste Exchanges
              </p>
              <p>A waste exchange, or virtual exchange, facilitates the use of a waste product from one process as a raw material for another. As with new life reuse of finished items, this avoids the environmental costs of disposing of the waste and obtaining new raw material, and may still be possible if the nature of the process makes avoiding the production of the waste or recycling it back into the original process impossible.</p>
<br/>
<p>This sort of scheme needs to have a far broader base than is currently the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once the demand for waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a &ldquo;waste&rdquo; but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.</p>

<p>Determining the balance of how the several effects of reuse interact are often best accomplished by a formal&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Life cycle assessment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment">life cycle assessment</a>. For example, research has shown that reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete product life cycle.&nbsp;A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint are reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the&nbsp;<a title="Supply chain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain">supply chain</a>&nbsp;is unknown.&nbsp;A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second-hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.</p>
<p>There are many ways of measuring the positive environmental, economic and social impact data. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li># of tons diverted from the landfill</li>
<li>$ avoided disposal costs</li>
<li>$ avoided purchase costs</li>
<li>$ value of materials donated</li>
<li>$ revenues earned</li>
