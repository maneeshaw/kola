                Most marine debris (80%) comes from trash and debris in urban
                runoff, i.e. land-based sources. Key components of land-based
                sources include litter, trash and debris from construction,
                ports and marinas, commercial and industrial facilities, and
                trash blown out of garbage containers, trucks, and landfills.1
                Ocean-based sources, such as, overboard discharges from ships
                and discarded fishing gear, account for the other 20%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Food containers and packaging are the largest component of the
                municipal solid waste stream (80 million tons or 31.7 %).2 These
                items, together with plastic bags, also represent the largest
                component of marine debris (that is, barring items less than 5mm
                such as pre-production plastic pellets, fragments, and
                polystyrene pieces).3 Packaging and single use disposable
                products are not only ubiquitous in marine debris, they
                represent an unsustainable use of precious resources (oil,
                trees, energy sources, water).

                <br />The quantity of marine debris is increasing in oceans
                world-wide
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Researchers at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation
                documented an increase in plastic debris in the Central Pacific
                Gyre five-fold between 1997 and 2007, where the baseline in 1997
                showed plastic pieces outnumbered plankton on the ocean surface
                6:1.4
              </p>
              <p>
                Off Japan's coast, the quantity of pelagic plastic particles
                floating increased 10 fold in 10 years between the 1970s and
                1980s, and then 10 fold every 2-3 years in the 1990s.5 In the
                Southern Ocean, plastic debris increased 100 times during the
                early 1990s.6 These increases in plastic debris occurred at the
                same time that worldwide production of plastic fibers
                quadrupled.

                <br />In the ocean, plastic debris injures and kills fish,
                seabirds and marine mammals.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Marine plastic pollution has impacted at least 267 species
                worldwide, including 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all
                seabird species and 43% of all marine mammal species. The
                impacts include fatalities as a result of ingestion, starvation,
                suffocation, infection, drowning, and entanglement.7
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2010, a California grey whale washed up dead on the shores of
                the Puget Sound. Autopsies indicated that its stomach contained
                a pair of pants and a golf ball, more than 20 plastic bags,
                small towels, duct tape and surgical gloves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seabirds that feed on the ocean surface are especially prone to
                ingesting plastic debris that floats. Adults feed these items to
                their chicks resulting in detrimental effects on chick growth
                and survival.8 One study found that approximately 98% of chicks
                sampled contained plastic and the quantity of plastic being
                ingested was increasing over time.9
              </p>
              <p>
                Because persistent organic pollutants in the marine environment
                attach to the surface of plastic debris, floating plastics in
                the oceans have been found to accumulate pollutants and
                transport them through ocean currents.10 Floating and migrating
                plastic debris has also been found to transport invasive marine
                species.11 Increasingly, research shows that marine life that
                ingests plastics coated with pollutants can absorb these
                pollutants their bodies.

                <br />Plastic debris is polluting the human food chain.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In a 2008 Pacific Gyre voyage, Algalita researchers began
                finding that fish are ingesting plastic fragments and debris. Of
                the 672 fish caught during that voyage, 35% had ingested plastic
                pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plastics industry, through the leadership of the American
                Chemical Council (ACC), spends millions of dollars each year to
                convince policy makers and Californians that solutions to
                plastic pollution lie in anti-litter campaigns that attribute
                the responsibility for marine debris on individual behavior. Yet
                they have devoted little funding to public education and much
                more on promoting policies that support increased use of
                plastics.
              </p>
              <p class="sub">
                While increased public education to prevent littering is
                important, proper management of litter fails to address the
                unsustainable consumption of resources involved in producing
                packaging and single use disposable goods.
              </p>
              <p class="sub">
                Furthermore, as the amount of disposable packaging and products
                continues to increase, controlling litter through public
                education and cleanup of streets and waterways requires
                significant and sustained funding.
              </p>
              <p class="sub">
                Preventing the generation of disposable products as much as
                possible reduces the amount of money needed for controlling and
                managing trash and litter. Prevention is both cost-effective and
                better for the environment.
