            Over a few decades, humans have managed to dump tons upon tons of garbage into the ocean. Of the most
            devastating elements of this pollution is that plastics takes thousands of years to decay. As a result, fish
            and wildlife are becoming intoxicated. Consequently the toxins from the plastics have entered the food
            chain, threatening human health. In the most polluted places in the ocean, the mass of plastic exceeds the
            amount of plankton six times over. This is a large piece of evidence that leaves the problem of polluted
            oceans undeniable. It is upsetting that more of clean up effort is not taking place.

            The Three Plastic Islands</p> <br />
          <p>
            The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also know as the Pacific Trash Vortex or gyre, is located in the central
            North Pacific Ocean and is larger than the state of Texas. There are also garbage patches in the Indian and
            Atlantic ocean. The patches are defined as containing a higher amount of plastic as compared to surrounding
            oceans. To date, five patches in total have been discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plastics are transported and converge in the ocean where currents meet. This means that huge plastic islands
            are made as a result. SES (Sea Education Society) scientists studied plastics in the Atlantic and calculated
            there are 580,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer.

            Sources of Plastic Toxins Entering the Oceanic Food Chain</p> <br />
          <p>
            As far as plastic entering the ocean, about 20% of the trash comes from ships and platforms that are
            offshore. The rest sources from litter being blown into the sea, picked up by tides on the beach, or
            intentional garbage dumping. The worse part is, these plastics don't biodegrade, so they break up into tiny
            pieces that are consumed by fish and sea mammals. Plastic is killing more than 100,000 sea turtles and birds
            a year from ingestion and entanglement. To learn more visit Project Green Bag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chemicals in plastics are released into the water as well as the atmosphere. Fish easily become contaminated
            from the chemicals in the water. This is a direct link of how plastic chemicals enter the food chain.

            Plastics getting to Humans Impacting Health
          </p>
          <p>
            Different plastics spread throughout the ocean. As Styrofoam breaks into smaller parts, polystyrene
            components in it sink lower in the ocean, so that the pollutant spreads throughout the sea column.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, not only do the toxins in plastic affect the ocean, but acting like sponges, they soak up other
            toxins from outside sources before entering the ocean. As these chemicals are ingested by animals in the
            ocean, this is not good for humans. We as humans ingest contaminated fish and mammals.
          </p>
          <p>There are different types of ways that plastic is dangerous for humans. Direct toxicity from plastics comes
            from lead, cadmium, and mercury. These toxins have also been found in many fish in the ocean, which is very
            dangerous for humans. Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) contained in some plastics, is a toxic carcinogen. Other
            toxins in plastics are directly linked to cancers, birth defects, immune system problems, and childhood
            developmental issues.</p>
          <p>Other types of toxic plastics are BPA or health-bisphenol-A, along with phthalates (mentioned above). Both
            of these are of great concern to human health. BPA is used in many things including plastic bottles and food
            packaging materials. Over time the polymer chains of BPA break down, and can enter the human body in many
            ways from drinking contaminated water to eating a fish that is exposed to the broken down toxins.
            Specifically, BPA is a known chemical that interferes with human hormonal function.</p>
          <p>Rolf Halden, associate professor in the School of Sustainable Engineering and Arizona State University has
            studied plastics adverse effects on humans and has thus far concluded that and exact outline of health
            effects of plastics on humans is almost impossible to determine. This is due to the fact that the problem of
            plastic contamination in humans is globally spread; there are almost no unexposed subjects. That being said,
            it is evident that the chemicals are not healthy for humans.</p>

          <p class="bold"> <br />Prevention of Contamination</p>
          <br />
          <p>As quoted by UN Environment Programme Executive Director Achim Steiner,</p>
          <p>"Marine debris – trash in our oceans – is a symptom of our throw-away society and our approach to how we
            use our natural resources."</p>
          <p>Our tendency as humans to be irresponsible about cleaning up after ourselves is about to get us in trouble.
            We risk losing many species in the ocean as well as negatively affecting ourselves. The average person
            produces half a pound of plastic waste every day. No wonder the oceans are filling up with waste!</p>
          <p> I think part of the problem is that we don't recognize how this issue starts with the individual. There
            are obviously life style changes we can make to solve this problem. We just have to be willing to accept
            this issue and look past our denial. The government also needs to make regulations on plastics if anything
            is going to change. </p>
          <p> Surprisingly, there is little to no information on governmental websites about pollution in the oceans. I
            think they are afraid to address the problem; it is a costly fix. However there have been some treaties
            formed to minimize the amount of trash entering the oceans. This is still not enough. To see more on EPA
            laws and treaties visit US Environmental Protection Agency. These grassroots organizations are vital then to
            the protection of the oceans, striving to get information out about this tragic pollution. We should really
            all be involved though, it is everyone's responsibility. Lets make these changes before it is too late and
            we kill the all oceanic life, or even our own.</p>
