            <p>You­ have just finished your meal at a fast food restaurant and you throw your uneaten food, food
              wrappers, drink cup, utensils and napkins into the trash can. You don't think about that waste again. On
              trash pickup day in your neighborhood, you push your can out to the curb, and workers dump the contents
              into a big truck and haul it away. You don't have to think about that waste again, either. But maybe you
              have wondered, as you watch the trash truck pull away, just where that garbage ends up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Americans generate trash at an astonishing rate of 4.6 pounds (2.1 kilograms) per day per person, which
              translates to 251 million tons (228 million metric tons) per year [source: EPA]. This is almost twice as
              much trash per person as most other major countries. What happens to this trash? Some gets recycled or
              recovered and some is burned, but the majority is buried in landfills. In this article, we will examine
              how a landfill is made, what happens to the trash in landfills, what problems are associated with a
              landfill and how these problems are solved.

            <p class="bold"><br />How Much Trash is Generated?</p>
            <p>
              ­Of the 251 million tons (228 million metric tons) of trash, or solid waste, generated in the United
              States in 2006, about 81.8 million tons (74.2 million metric tons), or 32.5 percent, was either recycled
              or composted [source: EPA]. Before recycling, trash mostly consists of paper products, yard clippings,
              plastics and food waste.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold"><br />How is Trash Disposed?</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              ­The trash production in the United States has almost tripled since 1960. This trash is handled in various
              ways. About 32.5 percent of the trash is recycled or composted, 12.5 percent is burned and 55 percent is
              buried in landfills [source: EPA]. The amount of trash buried in landfills has doubled since 1960. The
              United States ranks about in the middle of the major countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France
              and Japan) in landfill disposal. The United Kingdom ranks highest, burying about 90 percent of its solid
              waste in landfills.

            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold"><br />What is a Landfill?</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are two ways to bury trash:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Dump</strong> - an open hole in the ground where trash is buried and that has various animals
              (rats, mice, birds) swarming around. (This is most people's idea of a landfill!)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Landfill</strong> - carefully designed structure built into or on top of the ground in which trash
              is isolated from the surrounding environment (groundwater, air, rain). This isolation is accomplished with
              a bottom liner and daily covering of soil. A sanitary landfill uses a clay liner to isolate the trash from
              the environment. A municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill uses a synthetic (plastic) liner to isolate the
              trash from the environment
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The purpose of a landfill is to bury the trash in such a way that it will be isolated from groundwater,
              will be kept dry and will not be in contact with air. Under these conditions, trash will not decompose
              much. A landfill is not like a compost pile, where the purpose is to bury trash in such a way that it will
              decompose quickly.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Proposing the Landfill
            </p>
            <p>For a landfill to be built, the operators have to make sure that they follow certain steps. In most parts
              of the world, there are regulations that govern where a landfill can be placed and how it can operate. The
              whole process begins with someone proposing the landfill.</p>
            <p>In the United States, taking care of trash and building landfills are local government responsibilities.
              Before a city or other authority can build a landfill, an environmental impact study must be done on the
              proposed site to determine:</p>
            <br />
            <p>- the area of land necessary for the landfill</p>
            <br />
            <p>- the composition of the underlying soil and bedrock</p>
            <br />
            <p>the flow of surface water over the site</p>
            <br />
            <p>the impact of the proposed landfill on the local environment and wildlife</p>
            <br />
            <p>the historical or archaeological value of the proposed site</p>
            <p>
              First, it must be determined if there is sufficient land for the landfill. To give you an idea how much
              land is needed for a landfill, we'll use the example of a site we visited, the North Wake County Landfill
              in Raleigh, North Carolina. This site has both a sanitary landfill, which was closed in 1997, and a
              working MSW landfill. The site takes up 230 acres of land, but only 70 acres is dedicated to the actual
              landfill. The remaining land is for the support areas (runoff collection ponds, leachate collection ponds,
              drop-off stations, areas for borrowing soil and 50- to 100-foot buffer areas).
            </p>
            <p>Second, the composition of the underlying soil and bedrock must be determined. The rocks should be as
              watertight as possible to prevent any leakage from reaching groundwater. The bedrock must not be fractured
              or you cannot predict where wastes might flow. You would not want the site near mines or quarries because
              these structures frequently contact the groundwater supply. At the same time, you must be able to sink
              wells at various points around the site to monitor the groundwater or to capture any escaping wastes.</p>
            <p>Third, the flow of water over the area must be studied. You do not want excess water from the landfill
              draining on to neighboring property or vice versa. Similarly, you do not want the landfill to be close to
              rivers, streams or wetlands so that any potential leakage from the landfill will not enter the groundwater
              or watershed.</p>
            <p>Fourth, you need to determine the potential effects of the landfill and possible contamination on local
              wildlife. For example, you would not want to locate it near nesting areas of local or migrating birds. You
              would want to avoid local fisheries, too.</p>
            <p>Fourth, you need to determine the potential effects of the landfill and possible contamination on local
              wildlife. For example, you would not want to locate it near nesting areas of local or migrating birds. You
              would want to avoid local fisheries, too.</p>
            <p>Finally, if the site contains any historical or archaeological artifacts, you would not want to build a
              landfill there.</p>
            <p>Once the environmental impact study has been completed, permits must be obtained from the local, state
              and federal governments. In addition, money will have to be raised from taxes or municipal bonds to build
              and operate the landfill. The North Wake County Landfill cost about $19 million to build and was paid for
              through municipal bonds. Because funding usually comes from some public source, public approval must be
              obtained through local governments or a referendum.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold"><br />Building the Landfill</p>
            <p>
              Once the environmental impact study is complete, the permits are granted and the money has been raised,
              construction begins. First, access roads to the landfill site must be built if they do not already exist.
              These roads will be used by construction equipment, sanitation services and the general public. After
              roads have been built, then the landfill can be excavated. In the North Wake County Landfill, the landfill
              began 10 feet below the road surface.

              itself and contains contaminating substances (leachate)</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Methane collection system </strong>- collects methane gas that is formed during the breakdown of
              trash</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Covering or cap</strong>- seals off the top of the landfill</p>
            <br />
            <p>Each of these parts is designed to address specific problems that are encountered in a landfill. So, as
              we discuss each part of the landfill, we'll explain what problem is solved.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Bottom Liner System
            </p>
            <p>A landfill's major purpose and one of its biggest challenges is to contain the trash so that the trash
              doesn't cause problems in the environment. The bottom liner prevents the trash from coming in contact with
              the outside soil, particularly the groundwater. In MSW landfills, the liner is usually some type of
              durable, puncture-resistant synthetic plastic (polyethylene, high-density polyethylene,
              polyvinylchloride). It is usually 30-100 mils thick. The plastic liner may be also be combined with
              compacted clay soils as an additional liner. The plastic liner may also be surrounded on either side by a
              fabric mat (geotextile mat) that will help to keep the plastic liner from tearing or puncturing from the
              nearby rock and gravel layers.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Cells (Old and New)
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps, the most precious commodity and overriding problem in a landfill is air space. The amount of
              space is directly related to the capacity and usable life of the landfill. If you can increase the air
              space, then you can extend the usable life of the landfill. To do this, trash is compacted into areas,
              called cells, that contain only one day's trash. In the North Wake County Landfill, a cell is
              approximately 50 feet long by 50 feet wide by 14 feet high (15.25m x 15.25m x 4.26m). The amount of trash
              within the cell is 2,500 tons and is compressed at 1,500 pounds per cubic yard! This compression is done
              by heavy equipment (tractors, bulldozers, rollers and graders) that go over the mound of trash several
              times). Once the cell is made, it is covered with six inches of soil and compacted further. Cells are
              arranged in rows and layers of adjoining cells (lifts).</p>
            <p>In addition to compressing the trash into cells, space is conserved by excluding bulky materials, such as
              carpets, mattresses, foam and yard waste, from the landfill.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Storm Water Drainage
            </p>
            <p>It is important to keep the landfill as dry as possible to reduce the amount of leachate. This can be
              done in two ways:</p>
            <p><strong>Exclude liquids from the solid waste.</strong>Solid waste must be tested for liquids before
              entering the landfill. This is done by passing samples of the waste through standard paint filters. If no
              liquid comes through the sample after 10 minutes, then the trash is accepted into the landfill.</p>
            <p><strong>Keep rainwater out of the landfill. </strong>To exclude rainwater, the landfill has a storm
              drainage system. Plastic drainage pipes and storm liners collect water from areas of the landfill and
              channel it to drainage ditches surrounding the landfill's base.</p>
            <p>The ditches are either concrete or gravel-lined and carry water to collection ponds to the side of the
              landfill. In the collection ponds, suspended soil particles are allowed to settle and the water is tested
              for leachate chemicals. Once settling has occurred and the water has passed tests, it is then pumped or
              allowed to flow off-site.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Leachate Collection System
            </p>
            <p>No system to exclude water from the landfill is perfect and water does get into the landfill. The water
              percolates through the cells and soil in the landfill much as water percolates through ground coffee in a
              drip coffee maker. As the water percolates through the trash, it picks up contaminants (organic and
              inorganic chemicals, metals, biological waste products of decomposition) just as water picks up coffee in
              the coffee maker. This water with the dissolved contaminants is called leachate and is typically acidic.
            </p>
            <p>To collect leachate, perforated pipes run throughout the landfill (Figure 3). These pipes then drain into
              a leachate pipe, which carries leachate to a leachate collection pond. Leachate can be pumped to the
              collection pond or flow to it by gravity, as it does in the North Wake County Landfill.</p>
            <p>The leachate in the pond is tested for acceptable levels of various chemicals (biological and chemical
              oxygen demands, organic chemicals, pH, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfate and chloride) and allowed to
              settle. After testing, the leachate must be treated like any other sewage/wastewater; the treatment may
              occur on-site or off-site. At the North Wake County Landfill, leachate is released to the wastewater
              treatment plant in Raleigh, where it is treated and released into the Neuse River. Some landfills
              recirculate the leachate and later treat it. This method reduces the volume of leachate from the landfill,
              but increases the concentrations of contaminants in the leachate.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Methane Collection System
            </p>
            <p>Bacteria in the landfill break down the trash in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic) because the landfill
              is airtight. A byproduct of this anaerobic breakdown is landfill gas, which contains approximately 50
              percent methane and 50 percent carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen. This presents a
              hazard because the methane can explode and/or burn. So, the landfill gas must be removed. To do this, a
              series of pipes are embedded within the landfill to collect the gas. In some landfills, this gas is vented
              or burned.</p>
            <p>More recently, it has been recognized that this landfill gas represents a usable energy source. The
              methane can be extracted from the gas and used as fuel. In the North Wake County Landfill, a company
              collects the landfill gas, extracts the methane, and sells it to a nearby chemical company to power its
              boilers. The extraction system is a split system, meaning that methane gas can go to the boilers and/or
              the methane flares that burn the gas. The reason for the split system is that the landfill will increase
              its gas production over time (from 300 cubic feet per minute to 1,250 cubic feet per minute) and exceed
              the capacity of the boilers at the chemical company. Therefore, the excess gas will have to be burned. It
              is not cost-effective to compress the excess gas to liquid and sell it.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Covering or Cap
            </p>
            <p>As mentioned above, each cell is covered daily with six inches of compacted soil. This covering seals the
              compacted trash from the air and prevents pests (birds, rats, mice, flying insects, etc.) from getting
              into the trash. This soil takes up quite a bit of space. Because space is a precious commodity, many
              landfills are experimenting with tarps or spray coverings of paper or cement/paper emulsions. These
              emulsions can effectively cover the trash, but take up only a quarter of an inch instead of 6 inches!</p>
            <p>When a section of the landfill is finished, it is covered permanently with a polyethylene cap (40 mil).
              The cap is then covered with a 2-foot layer of compacted soil. The soil is then planted with vegetation to
              prevent erosion of the soil by rainfall and wind. The vegetation consists of grass and kudzu. No trees,
              shrubs or plants with deep penetrating roots are used so that the plant roots do not contact the
              underlying trash and allow leachate out of the landfill.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, leachate may seep through weak point in the covering and come out on to the surface. It
              appears black and bubbly. Later, it will stain the ground red. Leachate seepages are promptly repaired by
              excavating the area around the seepage and filling it with well-compacted soil to divert the flow of

              <br />Groundwater Monitoring
            </p>
            <p>At many points surrounding the landfill are groundwater monitoring stations. These are pipes that are
              sunk into the groundwater so water can be sampled and tested for the presence of leachate chemicals. The
              temperature of the groundwater is measured. Because the temperature rises when solid waste decomposes, an
              increase in groundwater temperature could indicate that leachate is seeping into the groundwater. Also, if
              the pH of the groundwater becomes acidic, that could indicate seeping leachate.</p>

              <br />What Happens to Trash in a Landfill?
            </p>
            <p>Trash put in a landfill will stay there for a very long time. Inside a landfill, there is little oxygen
              and little moisture. Under these conditions, trash does not break down very rapidly. In fact, when old
              landfills have been excavated or sampled, 40-year-old Newspapers have been found with easily readable
              print. Landfills are not designed to break down trash, merely to bury it. When a landfill closes, the
              site, especially the groundwater, must be monitored and maintained for up to 30 years!</p>

              <br />How is a Landfill Operated?
            </p>
            <p>A landfill, such as the North Wake County Landfill, must be open and available every day. Customers are
              typically municipalities and construction/demolition companies, although residents may also use the
              landfill. </p>
            <p>Near the entrance of the the site is a recycling center where residents can drop off recyclable materials
              (aluminum cans, glass bottles, Newspapers, blend paper, corrugated cardboard). This helps to reduce the
              amount of material in the landfill. Some of these materials are banned from landfills by law because they
              can be recycled.</p>
            <p>As customers enter the site, their trucks are weighed at the scale house. Customers are charged tipping
              fees for using the site. The tipping fees vary from $10 to $40 per ton. These fees are used to pay for
              bonds or operation costs. The North Wake County Landfill has an operating budget of approximately $4.5
              million, and part of that comes from tipping fees.</p>
            <p>Along the site, there are drop-off stations for materials that are not wanted or legally banned by the
              landfill. A multi-material drop-off station is used for tires, motor oil, lead-acid batteries and drywall.
              Some of these materials can be recycled.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is a household hazardous waste drop-off station for chemicals (paints, pesticides,
              other chemicals) that are banned from the landfill. These chemicals are disposed by private companies.
              Some paints can be recycled and some organic chemicals can be burned in incinerators or power plants.</p>
            <p>Other structures alongside the landfill are the borrowed area that supplies the soil for the landfill,
              the runoff collection pond, leachate collection ponds, and methane station.</p>
            <p>Landfills are complicated structures that, when properly designed and managed, serve an important
              purpose. In the future, new technologies called bioreactors will be used to speed the breakdown of trash
              in landfills and produce more methane.</p>
