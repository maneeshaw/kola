            <p><strong>Recycling</strong>&nbsp;is the process of converting&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Waste"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste">waste</a>&nbsp;materials into new materials and objects. It
              is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

              consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

              recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting
              waste outputs out of the economic system.</p>
            <p>There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_waste">garden waste</a>&mdash;is also a form of
              recycling.&nbsp;Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up
              from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing
              new products.</p>
            <p>In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same
              material&mdash;for example used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                title="Polystyrene" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene">polystyrene</a>&nbsp;foam into new
              polystyrene. This is accomplished when recycling certain types of materials, such as metal cans, which can
              become a can again and again, indefinitely, without losing purity in the product. However, this is often
              difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources),
              so "recycling" of many products or materials involves their&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" title="Reuse"
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse">reuse</a></em>&nbsp;in producing different materials (for

              instead. Another form of recycling is the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Waste sorting"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_sorting">salvage</a>&nbsp;of certain materials from complex
              products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="mw-redirect"

              of&nbsp;mercury&nbsp;from&nbsp;thermometers&nbsp;and&nbsp;thermostats).</p>

              <br />Legislation
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="sub">Supply</p>
            <p>For a recycling program to work, having a large, stable&nbsp;supply&nbsp;of recyclable material is
              crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply: mandatory recycling
              collection,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="mw-redirect" title="Container deposit legislation"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_deposit_legislation">container deposit legislation</a>,
              and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the
              form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target
              date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.</p>
            <p>Container deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers, typically
              glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to
              the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection
              point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling
              rate.&nbsp;Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and
              consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas.&nbsp;A variation
              on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European
              Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.
            </p>
            <p>An alternative way to increase the supply of recyclates is to&nbsp;ban&nbsp;the disposal of certain
              materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. One aim of this
              method is to create a viable economy for the proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that
              enough of these recycling&nbsp;services&nbsp;exist, or such bans simply lead to increased&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                class="mw-redirect" title="Fly-tipping" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-tipping">illegal
                dumping</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="sub">Government-mandated demand</p>
            <p>Legislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of
              such legislation exist: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Procurement"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement">procurement</a>&nbsp;policies, and recycled&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                class="mw-redirect" title="Mandatory labeling"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_labeling">product labeling</a>.</p>
            <p>Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing
              manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage
              of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option:
              industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract
              recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large
              increase in reporting requirements they impose and claim that they rob the industry of necessary
              flexibility.</p>
            <p>Governments&nbsp;have used their own&nbsp;purchasing power&nbsp;to increase recycling demand through what
              are called "procurement policies". These policies are either "set-asides", which reserve a certain amount
              of spending solely towards recycled products, or "price preference" programs which provide a
              larger&nbsp;budget&nbsp;when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific
              cases: in the United States, for example, the&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                title="United States Environmental Protection Agency"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">Environmental
                Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from
              recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.</p>
            <p>The final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are
              required to label their packaging with the amount of recycled material in the product (including the
              packaging), consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient&nbsp;buying
              power&nbsp;can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers to increase the amount
              of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling
              can also have a positive effect on the supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how
              and where the product can be recycled.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Recyclates
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>"Recyclate" is a raw material that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials
              recovery facility which will be used to form new products.&nbsp;The material is collected in various
              methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re-manufacturing so that it can be used in the
              production of new materials or products. For example,&nbsp;plastic bottles&nbsp;that are collected can be
              re-used and made into plastic pellets, a new product.</p> <br />
            <br />
            <p class="sub">Quality of recyclate</p>
            <p>The quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that need to be addressed for
              the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is
              generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount
              of non-target material and other non-recyclable material.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, steel and metal are
              materials with a higher
              recyclate quality. It's estimated that two-thirds of all new steel manufactured comes from recycled
              steel.&nbsp;Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and
              non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling products.&nbsp;A high proportion of
              non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve
              "high-quality" recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being
              down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled.&nbsp;For example, to
              facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass
              going into the re-melt process. Another example is the downcycling of plastic, in which products such as
              plastic food packaging are often downcycled into lower quality products, and do not get recycled into the
              same plastic food packaging.</p>
            <p>The quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant
              environmental benefits by reducing, reusing and keeping products out of landfills. High-quality recycling
              can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected.
              Higher-income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to
              local governments, households, and businesses. Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer
              and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that
              sector.</p>
            <p>There are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material
              quality of recyclate. It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in
              recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to
              discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can
              result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra
              effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the
              quality of the final product.&nbsp;Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more
              difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred
              percent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which
              can see a loss in recyclate quality.&nbsp;The storage of materials outside, where the product can become
              wet, can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to
              further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.&nbsp;Each action along the recycling
              path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.</p> <br />
            <br />
            <p class="sub">Quality recyclate action plan
              (Scotland)</p>
            <p>The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that
              the&nbsp;Scottish Government&nbsp;would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the
              materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported
              or sold on to the reprocessing market.</p>
            <p>The plan's objectives are to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Drive up the quality of recyclate</li>
              <li>Deliver greater transparency about the quality of recyclate</li>
              <li>Provide help to those contracting with materials recycling facilities to identify what is required of
                them</li>
              <li>Ensure compliance with the Waste (Scotland) regulations 2012</li>
              <li>Stimulate a household market for quality recyclate</li>
              <li>Address and reduce issues surrounding the Waste Shipment Regulations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The plan focuses on three key areas, with fourteen actions that were identified to increase the quality
              of materials collected, sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland.</p>
            <p>The three areas of focus are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collection systems and input contamination</li>
              <li>Sorting facilities &ndash; material sampling and transparency</li>
              <li>Material quality benchmarking and standards</li>

            <div class="HorLine5"></div>
            <p class="bold">
              <br />Recycling consumer waste
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="sub">Collection</p>
            <p class="magnify">A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the
              general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and
              government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are "drop-off centers", "buy-back
              centers", and "curbside collection".</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p class="sub">Curbside collection</p>
            <p>Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems,
              which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are
              mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation.&nbsp;A&nbsp;waste collection
              vehicle&nbsp;generally picks up the waste.</p>
            <p>At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with
              the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting
              facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to
              reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and
              no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all
              sorting happens in a central location.</p>
            <p>In a commingled or&nbsp;single-stream system, all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate
              from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require&nbsp;public
              education&nbsp;on what materials are recyclable.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p class="sub">Source separation</p>
            <p>Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection.
              This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs
              additional&nbsp;operating costs&nbsp;for collection of each separate material. An extensive public
              education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate&nbsp;contamination&nbsp;is to be
              avoided.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Oregon, USA, its
              environmental authority Oregon DEQ surveyed multi-family property managers and about half of them reported
              problems including contamination of recyclables due to trespassers such as&nbsp;transients&nbsp;gaining
              access to the collection areas.</p>
            <p>Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled
              (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead
              substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what is
              called&nbsp;<em>co-mingled collection</em>.</p>

            <p class="sub">Buy-back centers</p>

            <p>Buy-back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing
              a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If
              this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the
              emission of greenhouse gasses. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable
              enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="National Waste &amp; Recycling Association"

              for $30.</p>
            <p>In the US, the value per ton of mixed recyclables was $180 in 2011, $80 in 2015, and $100 in 2017.<sup

            <p class="sub">Sorting</p>
            <p>Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Materials recovery facility"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_recovery_facility">materials recovery facility</a>, the
              different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve
              automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour.&nbsp;Some
              plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Single-stream recycling"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stream_recycling">single-stream recycling</a>. Automatic
              sorting may be aided by robotics and machine learning.&nbsp;In plants, a variety of materials is sorted
              such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of
              batteries.&nbsp;A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants
              exist. In the United States, there are over 300 materials recovery facilities.</p>
            <p>Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor
              belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of&nbsp;corrugated fiberboard&nbsp;and&nbsp;plastic
              bags&nbsp;are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.</p>
            <p>Next, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight,
              splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed
              paper and the most common types of plastic,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Polyethylene terephthalate"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate">PET</a>&nbsp;(#1) and&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                class="mw-redirect" title="HDPE" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDPE">HDPE</a>&nbsp;(#2) are
              collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers:
              a&nbsp;spectroscopic&nbsp;scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic
              based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection
              channel.</p>
            <p>Strong magnets are used to separate out&nbsp;ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and&nbsp;tin
              cans.&nbsp;Non-ferrous metals&nbsp;are ejected by magnetic&nbsp;eddy currents&nbsp;in which a
              rotating&nbsp;magnetic field&nbsp;induces&nbsp;an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn
              creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic&nbsp;eddy current&nbsp;is repulsed by a
              large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.</p>
            <p>Finally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may either be sorted
              by hand<span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;</span>or via an automated machine that uses colored
              filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than 10 millimeters (0.39&nbsp;in) across
              cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as "glass fines".</p>
            <p>This process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it
              reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, saves energy, reduces
              greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new
              products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.</p>

              <br />Recycling industrial waste
            </p>
            <p>Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United
              Kingdom is generated by industry.&nbsp;The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the
              cost-effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly
              recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily with packaged goods, like&nbsp;retail
              stores,&nbsp;warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized
              products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.</p>
            <p>The glass, lumber,&nbsp;wood pulp&nbsp;and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled
              materials; however, old&nbsp;rubber tires&nbsp;may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers
              for a profit.</p>
            <p>Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="International Resource Panel"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resource_Panel">International Resource Panel</a>,
              hosted by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="United Nations Environment Programme"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme">United Nations Environment
                Programme</a>&nbsp;(UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society&nbsp;and their
              recycling rates. The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the
              21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications
              within society above ground. For example, the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to
              238&nbsp;kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.</p>
            <p>The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metal stocks in society can
              serve as huge mines above ground (the term "urban mining" has been coined with this idea in mind).
              However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that the
              recycling rates of some&nbsp;rare metals&nbsp;used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs
              for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically
              stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.</p>
            <p>The military recycles some metals. The&nbsp;U.S. Navy's Ship Disposal Program uses&nbsp;ship
              breaking&nbsp;to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an&nbsp;artificial
              reef.&nbsp;Uranium&nbsp;is a very dense metal that has qualities superior to lead
              and&nbsp;titanium&nbsp;for many military and industrial uses. The&nbsp;uranium&nbsp;left over from
              processing it into&nbsp;nuclear weapons&nbsp;and fuel for&nbsp;nuclear reactors&nbsp;is
              called&nbsp;depleted uranium, and is used by all branches of the U.S. military for the development of such
              things as armor-piercing shells and shielding.</p>
            <p>The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste
              materials for profit.</p>
            <p>Some industries, like the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="Renewable energy industry"

                industry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" class="mw-redirect" title="Solar photovoltaic"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_photovoltaic">solar photovoltaic</a>&nbsp;technology, in
              particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume
              to their waste streams, anticipating future demand during their rapid growth.</p>
            <p>Recycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of
              quality. Recycling of&nbsp;PVC&nbsp;often results in&nbsp;downcycling&nbsp;of the material, which means
              only products of lower quality standards can be made with the recycled material. A new approach that
              allows an equal level of quality is the&nbsp;Vinyloop&nbsp;process. It was used after the&nbsp;London
              Olympics 2012&nbsp;to fulfill the PVC Policy.</p>

            <p class="sub">E-waste recycling</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" title="Electronic waste" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste">E-waste</a>&nbsp;is a
              growing problem, accounting for 20&ndash;50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to
              the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">EPA</a>. It is also
              the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the
              cargo barge&nbsp;Khian Sea&nbsp;dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in&nbsp;Haiti, the&nbsp;Basel
              Convention&nbsp;was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created
              the&nbsp;e-Stewards&nbsp;certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for
              environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside
              other prominent legislation, such as the&nbsp;Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive&nbsp;of
              the EU the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from
              entering waterways and the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>In the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for
              reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is
              cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly 10 centimeters (3.9&nbsp;in) in size, and
              manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and&nbsp;capacitors&nbsp;which contain poisonous metals.
              The remaining pieces are further shredded to 10 millimeters (0.39&nbsp;in) particles and passed under a
              magnet to remove ferrous metals. An&nbsp;eddy current&nbsp;ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by
              density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and
              smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to
              re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the
              mercury backlight from LCDs.</p>

              <br />Plastic recycling
            </p>
            <p>Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into
              useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this
              could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables.&nbsp;For
              some types of plastic, the same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2&ndash;3 times before its
              quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p class="sub">Physical recycling</p>
            <p>Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted
              into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular
              weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase
              with each remelt.</p>
            <p>A commercial-built recycling facility is scheduled to be sent to the&nbsp;International Space
              Station&nbsp;in late 2019. The facility will take in plastic waste and unneeded plastic parts and
              physically convert them into spools of feedstock for the space station&nbsp;additive
              manufacturing&nbsp;facility used for in-space&nbsp;3D printing.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p class="sub">Chemical recycling</p>
            <p>For some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated
              with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with
              ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again. In
              2019,&nbsp;Eastman Chemical Company&nbsp;announced initiatives
              of&nbsp;methanolysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;syngas&nbsp;designed to handle a greater variety of used material.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p class="sub">Waste plastic pyrolysis to fuel oil</p>
            <p>Another process involves the conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise
              thermal&nbsp;depolymerization&nbsp;process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or a
              mix of polymers, including&nbsp;thermoset&nbsp;materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and
              the&nbsp;biopolymers&nbsp;in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals
              produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology&nbsp;plant of this type
              in&nbsp;Carthage, Missouri, US, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but
              is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result. Plastic Pyrolysis can
              convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the
              list of suitable plastic raw materials for&nbsp;pyrolysis:</p>

            <p>The (ideal) recycling process can be differentiated into three loops, one for manufacture

              retaining the product functionality ("reuse") or the product continues to be used but with altered
              functionality ("further use").&nbsp;The product design is unmodified, or only slightly modified, in both

            <p>Product disassembly requires&nbsp;<em>material recycling</em>&nbsp;where product materials are recovered

              terephthalate) is commonly found in&nbsp;soft drinks&nbsp;and&nbsp;water bottles. Type 2 (high-density
              polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as&nbsp;milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some
              dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains,&nbsp;hula
              hoops,&nbsp;credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density
              polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet.
              Type 5 is&nbsp;polypropylene&nbsp;and makes up syrup bottles, straws,&nbsp;Tupperware, and some automotive
              parts. Type 6 is&nbsp;polystyrene&nbsp;and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and
              compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon
              water bottles, cell phone, and tablet frames, safety goggles and sunglasses.&nbsp;Having a recycling code
              or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but
              rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.</p>

              <br />Public participation rates
            </p>
            <p>Changes that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a target="_blank" title="Single-stream recycling"
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stream_recycling">Single-stream recycling</a></li>
              <li><a target="_blank" title="Pay as you throw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_as_you_throw">Pay as you
                  throw</a>&nbsp;fees for trash</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25-fold, while recovery of the
              material remained below 5 percent.&nbsp;Many studies have addressed recycling behavior and strategies to
              encourage community involvement in recycling programs. It has been argued&nbsp;that recycling behavior is
              not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have
              evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the
              best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programs. However,
              recent studies have concluded that social pressure is unviable in this context.&nbsp;One reason for this
              is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic
              hunter-gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason
              is that individual recycling does not take place in public view.</p>
            <p>Following the increasing popularity of recycling collection being sent to the same landfills as trash,
              some people kept on putting recyclables on the recyclables bin.&nbsp;In Baltimore, the government kept
              collecting glass separately for seven years even though it did not recycle it.</p>
