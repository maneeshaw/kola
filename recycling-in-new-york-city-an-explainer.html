              <p>
                <br />Ever wondered if you can recycle bubble wrap? Or where to
                recycle batteries?  <br>New York City has a lot of rules when it
                comes to recycling, and it can be hard to keep up.  <br>Here’s a
                guide on what and how to recycle, as well as what can go in the
                organic waste collection. Of course the ultimate way to recycle
                items is to see if someone else can use them. Donate furniture, appliances and more via <a href="http://nyc.gov/donate">nyc.gov/donate</a>. You can even arrange to
                have some things picked up.

              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p>
                <br />New Yorkers must separate recyclables into mixed paper or
                cardboard; and metal, glass, plastic or cartons. Once separated,
                they need to be placed in <a href="https://shop.kolaproject.com/products/large-clear-plastic-recycling-bags-65-gallons">clear plastic bags</a> or recycling bins.

                Yes, you must empty and rinse out any plastic food containers
                before recycling them.

                the bottles out before recycling them.

                <br /><strong>How to recycle batteries</strong> <br />
                Household alkaline batteries can be thrown away in the regular
                trash. Rechargeable batteries must be brought back to the
                retailers or brought to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/events/events-filter.html">SAFE Disposal Event</a>. No batteries
                should ever go in recycling bins or bags.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p>
                <br /><strong> What to do with small appliances</strong><br />
                Small appliances, such as a toaster oven or hair dryer, can be
                recycled with plastics and metals. You must first remove all
                batteries.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p>
                <br /><strong> What about larger appliances?</strong><br />
                Before you get rid of larger appliances, including refrigerators
                and air conditioners, you must set up an appointment with the
                Department of Sanitation so that the CFC, or Freon, gas can be
                removed. <br>You can do this online at <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/contact/cfc-recovery-appointment-request">nyc.gov/dsny</a> or by calling
                311. You will then be able to recycle the appliance with
                metals/plastics. <br>For refrigerators and freezers, the locking
                device or hinges must be removed before placing it outside to be
                picked up.
              </p>

              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p>
                <br /><strong> What to do with electronics</strong><br />
                Electronics, such as computers, televisions, cellphones, power
                tools, electric razors and cameras, cannot be thrown away or
                recycled. They should be taken back to the retailers, which are
                required to accept them. They can also be taken to a SAFE
                Disposal Event or <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DSNY-Special-Waste-Drop-off-Sites/q6ei-tvmg">Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site</a>.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <div class="HorLine5"></div>
              <p>
                <br /><strong> What to do with light bulbs</strong><br />
                Compact fluorescent light bulbs should be returned to the
                retailer or taken to a SAFE Disposal Event or Household Special
                Waste Drop-Off Site. Other light bulbs can be thrown in the
                garbage. The Department of Sanitation recommends double bagging
                them before throwing them away.
              </p>

                <br /><strong> Did you know …</strong><br /><br />
                 <p class="sub">… smoke detectors are considered harmful products?</p><br /><br />

                <p>Smoke detectors contain small amounts of radioactive material.
                They should not be thrown in the trash and should be returned to
                the manufacturer or taken to the Department of Sanitation “Safe
                Disposal Events.”</p><br /><br />

                 <p class="sub">… some cosmetics companies will reward you for returning
                containers?</p><br /><br />

                <p>Some companies including <a href="https://m.maccosmetics.com/giving_back/printable_form.tmpl">MAC</a> and <a href="https://www.kiehls.com/recycle-and-be-rewarded">Kiehl’s</a> will give you free
                products for returning a certain number of empty containers. All
                empty metal, glass, or rigid plastic cosmetic containers should
                be recycled.</p><br /><br />

                 <p class="sub">… plastic bags should be returned to retailers?</p><br /><br />

                <p>Retailers with more than 10,000 square feet or those part of a
                chain with more than five stores that are more than 5,000 square
                feet must provide bins for collected used plastic bags, under
                state law. Plastic bags cannot be recycled.</p>
