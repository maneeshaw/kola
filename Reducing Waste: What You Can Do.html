                                    Tips for Home
                                </p>
                                <p>The best place to start making a difference is right in your own home. Learn how you can reduce, reuse, and recycle materials to decrease household waste. The tips below will help you get started.</p>
                                <p class="sub">Lawn and Garden</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Learn to compost at home. Use food scraps, yard trimmings, and other organic wastes to create a compost pile. Adding the compost you make to soil increases water retention, decreases erosion, and keeps organic materials out of landfills.</li>
                                    <li>Raise the cutting height of your lawnmower during hot summer months to keep grass roots shaded and cooler, reducing weed growth, browning, and the need for watering.</li>
                                    <li>If you need large lawn and garden equipment such as tillers and chainsaws, you can reduce waste (and save money) by setting up a sharing program with your neighbors.</li>
                                    <li>When you mow, “grasscycle” by leaving grass clippings on your lawn instead of bagging then. The clippings will return nutrients to the soil instead of taking up space in landfills.</li>
                                    <li>Donate healthy plants that you want to replace to community gardens, parks and schools.</li>
                                    <li>If you have a wood burning fireplace, save your ashes instead of throwing them away. Once cooled, wood ashes can be mixed into your compost heap and provide nutrients to your garden.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p class="sub">Home Improvement</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use insulation made from recycled paper, glass, and other recovered materials.</li>
                                    <li>Clean and properly store tools, toys and outdoor furniture to protect them from damage and keep them out of landfills.</li>
                                    <li>Turn off or unplug lights during the day. Doing so will save energy and help your lights last longer.</li>
                                    <li>Storms can cause power outages. Prevent waste by keeping rechargeable batteries for your flashlights. If you do use disposable batteries, reduce hazardous waste by buying ones with low mercury content.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p class="sub">Moving and Cleaning</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Have a yard sale to find homes for clothes, toys, appliances, and books that you no longer need.</li>
                                    <li>When moving, use old newspapers to wrap fragile materials.</li>
                                    <li>Use moving boxes with the highest content of recycled paper and bubble wrap containing recycled plastic. Be sure to recycle packaging materials after your move. Many organizations, such as U-Haul, have places where you can drop of unused boxes for others to reuse.</li>
                                    <li>Be sure to properly dispose of any non-recyclable items that you won’t be taking with you. Look for household hazardous waste collection days in your community to properly dispose of cleaners, paints, automotive supplies and other hazardous items.</li>
                                    <li>For cleaning chores, buy reusable mops, rags and sponges. When using cleaning products, use only the amount you need and follow the bottle’s directions for use and disposal.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br>
                                <p>Students, parents, and teachers can all make a difference in reducing waste at school. By practicing the "3 R's" of waste reduction—reduce, reuse, and recycle—we can all do our part.</p>
                                <p class="sub">Green School Supplies</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Think green before you shop. Before starting the new school year, look through last year’s materials. Many items can be reused or recycled.</li>
                                    <li>Purchase and use school supplies made from recycled products, such as pencils made from old blue jeans and binders made from old shipping boxes.</li>
                                    <li>Keep waste out of landfills by using school supplies wrapped in minimal packaging, and buying in bulk when possible.</li>
                                    <li>Save packaging, colored paper, egg cartons and other items for arts and crafts projects. Look for other ways that you can reduce the amount of packing that you throw away..</li>
                                    <li>Maintain new school supplies. Keep track of pens and pencils. Make an effort to put your things in a safe place every day. This will not only reduce waste, but save you money in the long run.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>If you bring your lunch to school, package it in reusable containers instead of disposable ones. Carry food in reusable plastic or cloth bags, and bring drinks in a thermos instead of disposable bottles or cartons. Read EPA's Pack a Waste Free Lunch guide for more tips.</li>
                                    <li>When buying lunch, grab only what you need. Too often extra ketchup packets and napkins go to waste.</li>
                                    <li>Remember to recycle your cans and bottles after you finish eating.</li>
                                    <li>Work with your teachers to set up a composting program at school.</li>
                                    <li>Make posters that remind students what can be composted or recycled.</li>

                                    <li>Instead of printing hard copies of your documents, save them to your hard drive or email them to yourself to save paper.</li>
                                    <li>Make your printer environmentally friendly. Change your printer settings to make double-sided pages. Use small point fonts when possible and use the “fast draft" setting when possible to save ink.</li>
                                    <li>Pay your bills via e-billing programs when possible to save paper.</li>
                                    <li>Use paperclips (over staples) when possible.</li>
                                    <li>Reuse envelopes with metal clasps and reuse file folders by sticking a new label over the previous one.</li>

                                <p>Citizens in every community can do many activities to work together and reduce waste. Each of us can make a difference by reducing, reusing, and recycling materials throughout our communities-and encouraging our neighbors to do the same.</p>

                                    <li>Donate your old computers and tablets to a school. Many schools will be able to make good use of your old machine.</li>
                                    <li>Before replacing a computer that no longer fits your needs, consider enhancing the computer’s capacity by upgrading the hard drive or memory. This can save you money too.</li>
                                    <li>Donating used (but still operating) electronics for reuse extends the lives of valuable products and keeps them out of the waste stream for a longer period of time.

                                        Organize a recycling drive in your neighborhood or at school. Collect bottles, glass, plastic, newspapers or books and take them to your local recycling center or a charity in need.

                                        Set up a composting program for your neighborhood or school. It only takes a small amount of land space to collect organic waste into a compost pile. The compost can be bagged and sold for community and school funds.

                                        When visiting beaches and parks, be sure to take back everything you bring in, so that you can leave places unlittered and undisturbed.

                                        To pass the time on long drives or rainy vacation days, bring scrap paper for drawing and games.

                                        Hot summer days make you thirsty. Be sure to recycle your used drink containers. Consider putting a filter on your water tap and refilling bottles with the filtered water. Instead of buying many small drink bottles, buy drink mixes in bulk and fill your reusable bottles.
                                    </li>

                                        Share the ride and the road. Public transportation and carpooling reduce pollution.

                                        If you change your own motor oil, collect and store used oil in a sturdy plastic container and take it to a recycling center.Dumping oil down storm drains or on the ground can contaminate groundwater.

                                        Purchase extended life anti-freeze for your car. When it’s time to change it out, take your used anti-freeze to a recycling center. Call 1-800-CLEANUP or visit Earth 911's website to find the recycling center nearest to you.

                                        Take used or damaged car batteries to auto stores that stock or repair lead-acid batteries for safe disposal. The batteries contain toxic amounts of lead and acid, and should not be thrown out with your regular trash.

                                        Make sure your car has a clean air filter—a dirty air filter can increase your car’s fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent.
Instead of sending your car to a low-value car to a landfill, offer it to a local charity. The gift will be tax-deductible.

                                    <li>After holiday festivities, put leftovers in recyclable containers, and share them with family, friends, or others. Donate untouched leftovers from parties to a local food bank or homeless shelter.</li>
                                    <li>After parties, fill your dishwasher up completely before running it. You will run fewer cycles, which saves energy.</li>
