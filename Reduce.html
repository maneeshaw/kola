            <p>Waste reduction is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of waste produced. By
              reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimization supports
              efforts to promote a more sustainable society. Waste minimization involves redesigning products and
              processes and/or changing societal patterns of consumption and production.</p>

            <p>The most environmentally resourceful, economically efficient, and cost-effective way to manage waste
              often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see a waste reduction as a
              primary focus for most waste management strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a
              significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimization can be
              considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.</p>

            <p>Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on re-use,
              recycling, and waste-to-energy conversion. Waste reduction involves efforts to avoid creating waste during
              manufacturing. To effectively implement waste reduction the manager requires knowledge of the production
              process, cradle-to-grave analysis (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to
              earth) and details of the composition of the waste.</p>

            <p>The main sources of waste vary from country to country. In the UK, most waste comes from the construction
              and demolition of buildings, followed by mining and quarrying, industry and commerce. Household waste
              constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste. Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in
              the supply chain. For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using
              particular packing because it fits downstream needs.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Efficient production practices. Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of
                input of&nbsp;<a title="Raw material" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material">raw
                  materials</a>.</li>
              <li>Economic returns. More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials
                improving the financial performance of a company.</li>
              <li><a title="Reputation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation">Public image</a>. The
                environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation
                reflects a proactive movement towards&nbsp;<a title="Environmental protection"
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection">environmental protection</a>.</li>
              <li>Quality of products produced. New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation
                and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.</li>

                Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations,

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>In industry, using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the
              production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of
              innovative and commercially successful replacement products.</p>
            <p>Waste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings.
              However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another
              part.</p>

            <p>Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for&nbsp;<a title="Manufacturing"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing">manufactured products</a>&nbsp;can most easily be
              done at the design stage. Reducing the number of&nbsp;<a class="extiw" title="wikt:component"
                href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/component">components</a>&nbsp;used in a product or making the
              product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.
            </p>
            <p>In some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of&nbsp;<a title="Raw material"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material">raw materials</a>&nbsp;used to make a product, but
              instead reduce the volume or&nbsp;<a title="Toxicity"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity">toxicity</a>&nbsp;of the waste created at the end of a
              product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="sub">Fitting the intended use</p>
            <p>In this strategy, products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use. This applies
              especially to packaging materials, which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended
              purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in
              its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of paper, metals,
              glass and plastics in its packaging.</p>
            <p class="sub">Durability</p>
            <p>Improving product durability, such as extending a vacuum cleaner's useful life to 15 years instead of 12,
              can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.</p>

            <p>But in some cases it has a negative environmental impact. If a product is too durable, its replacement
              with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed. Therefore, extending an older machine's useful
              life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new
              model. Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern
              counterparts.</p>

            <p>Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured
              product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.[5]</p>

            <p>Making refillable glass bottles strong enough to withstand several journeys between the consumer and the
              bottling plant requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to
              transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the
              number of return journeys bottles make. If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only
              several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single
              journey..</p>

            <p>Many choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to
              make informed decisions.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Various aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of disposable tableware in
              restaurants.</p>
            <p class="sub">Reusable shopping bags</p>
            <p>Reusable bags are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a &quot;bag credit&quot; for reusable
              shopping bags, although at least one chain reversed its policy, claiming &quot;it was just a temporary
              bonus&quot;. In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar
              discount. (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount
              vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.) While there is a minor inconvenience involved,
              this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.</p>

            <p>Health-care establishments are massive producers of waste. The major sources of health-care waste are
              hospitals, laboratories, and research centers, mortuary and autopsy centers, animal research and testing
              laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.</p>

            <p>Waste minimization can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less

              facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.</p>
